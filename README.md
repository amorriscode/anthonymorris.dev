# Anthony Morris | Software Engineer ðŸš€

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anthony Morris.

I'm a software engineer currently working for a [networking company](https://www.cisco.com). I'm endlessly curious, always looking to improve. To do that while working, I'm [studying computer science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london).

Writing code has allowed me to become a builder. I want to use my skills to do something positive for others.

I have a strong interest in building products that people love. Products that are a pleasure to use, a pleasure to look at, and make us better off as humans.
