Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. My personal playground.

A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There might be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you decided to stop by.

I'm focusing on empowering learners around the world at [Monthly](https://monthly.com). During my free time, I'm [building 12 products in 12 months](https://12products.xyz).

Some other things I'm interested in are space, books, science, awareness, fitness, Dungeons & Dragons, and making music. If you like these things, we should chat.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/amorriscode), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amorriscode), [GitHub](https://github.com/amorriscode), or [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171404-anthony).
