# Anthony Morris | Software Engineer

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. My personal playground.

A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There might be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you decided to stop by.

Some things I'm interested in are space, books, science, fitness, Dungeons & Dragons, and making music. If you like these things, we should chat.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/amorriscode), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amorriscode), [GitHub](https://github.com/amorriscode), or [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171404-anthony).
