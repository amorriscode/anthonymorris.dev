Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. My personal playground.

A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There might be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you decided to stop by.

I'm fascinated with the world around us. I intend to write about various things I learn in hopes of improving my understanding. Currently, I'm focusing on empowering learners around the world at [Monthly](https://monthly.com).

Some other things you might find me talk about are space, books, science, awareness, fitness, Dungeons & Dragons, and making music. If you like these things, we should chat.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/amorriscode), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amorriscode), [GitHub](https://github.com/amorriscode), or [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171404-anthony).
