        <p>
          We often optimize our lives for money, fun, or output. We know we have limited time but it's hard to put it all in context. I've been trying to remind myself that my time is limited. I've <a href="/projects/social-media-death-clock">built projects around the idea</a>, <a href="https://dailystoic.com/you-could-leave-life-right-now-let-that-determine-what-you-do-and-say-and-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased a token as a reminder</a>, and I even have some tattoos related to the theme. But still, it's hard to visualize.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a reminder for me to cherish the life I have. To do the things I want to do and be with the people I want to be with. To let go of the things that don't matter or aren't in my control.

          Each box below represents one week of my life. The amount of years are based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">average life expectancy of a male living in Canada</a>. Everything that is filled out is in the past.
