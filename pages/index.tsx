              A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There
              might be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you

              about various things I learn in hopes of improving my

              Some other things you might find me talk about are space, books,
              science, awareness, fitness, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and making
              music. If you like these things, we should chat.
