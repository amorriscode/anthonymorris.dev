          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
        </h1>

        <p>Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. My personal playground.</p>

        <p>A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There might be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you decided to stop by.</p>

        <p>I'm fascinated with the world around us. I intend to write about various things I learn in hopes of improving my understanding. Currently, I'm focusing on computer science and building products that have a positive impact on the world.</p>

        <p>Some other things you might find me talk about are space, books, science, awareness, fitness, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and making music. If you like these things, we should chat.</p>

        <p>You can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/amorriscode">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amorriscode">LinkedIn</a> but I'm trying to spend less time on social media these days.</p>
