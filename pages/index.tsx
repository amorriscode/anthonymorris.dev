        <p>Welcome to my corner of the interwebs. My personal playground.</p>

        <p>
          A place for my words, photos, projects, and experiments. There might
          be nothing for you here and that's okay. I'm glad you decided to stop
          by.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm fascinated with the world around us. I intend to write about
          various things I learn in hopes of improving my understanding.
          Currently, I'm focusing on computer science and building products that
          have a positive impact on the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some other things you might find me talk about are space, books,
          science, awareness, fitness, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and making music.
          If you like these things, we should chat.
        </p>
