After I finished [Name of the Wind](/books/name-of-the-wind), I knew I'd have to dig into this one pretty quickly. It was hard for me to put it down.

The first book felt like a bit of a slow burn for me. It's not like the most exciting things were happening in every chapter, but I still didn't want to put it down very often.

Wise Man's Fear left me feeling much the same. It picks up right where Name of the Wind left off. Kvothe is still telling his own story. This time we venture away from the University and get more of the outside world.

I loved reading about Kvothe's experience away from the University. It seems like his ego got a bit inflated from the relative safety of school (and his impressive performance). He still manages to slip out of fatal danger, but there are a few times when it felt like he was close to inevitable doom.

Again, I'm glad I came to the series late. This book was released in 2011 and the final book of the trilogy is no where to be found. Maybe it'll come out soon? If not, I guess I'll start the Wheel of Time series!
