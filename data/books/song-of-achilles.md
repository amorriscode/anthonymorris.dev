I have never read the [[Iliad]]. It's one of the timeless classics that has been on my list for a long time. Unfortunately, I just haven't made my way through many classics. Thanks to Madeline Miller, I got to enjoy the story of [[Achilles]] in a refreshing modern take.

If you aren't familiar with the [[Iliad]], it's a story about the ten-year siege of the city of Troy. The original story only covers a few weeks of the war, *The Song of Achilles* tells us about [[Achilles]] and his life leading up to the great war.

[[Achilles]] was the son of [[Peleus]], the king of [[Phthia]]. He spent his childhood like most princes probably do. Training, lounging, and enjoying a carefree life. He spent plenty of time playing with the other boys of the household; [[Peleus]] was kind and took in boys that had no place to call home.

The narrator of this modern epic is [[Patroclus]]. He was cast away from his home when he stood up for himself, pushing another boy to the ground where a sharp rock was waiting. Thankfully for [[Patroclus]], [[Peleus]] took him in.

Unlike [[Achilles]], there was nothing special about [[Patroclus]]. At least not on the surface. He was terribly normal. He spent a lot of his time admiring [[Achilles]] and the two eventually formed quite the bond. [[Achilles]] found [[Patroclus]] refreshing. He wasn't begging for [[Achilles]]' attention at all hours of the day like the other boys.

The two boys quickly become inseparable. They mature together while developing an intense romance. *The Song of Achilles* has some of the steamiest sexual encounters I've read and the romance burns bright until the end.

Miller's writing is beautiful. It's poetic, powerful, and a joy to read. The words flow off the page and I could hardly consume them fast enough. I didn't really know what I was getting into before I read the book. I picked it based on the title and it's great rating on Good Reads. It *did not* disappoint.

There could've been a bit better balance in the content of the book. I would've preferred equal parts Trojan War and budding romance. The war lasted a decade, but it seemed rushed in the book. As someone that signed up for mythology, there was more romance than I would've liked. However, it felt genuine, thoughtful, and was well written so I still enjoyed the book as a whole.

There is beauty in [[Patroclus]]' tragedy thanks to Miller's prose. Her command of the written word is one I wished existed in [Dune](/books/dune). I look forward to digging into the [[Iliad]] in 2021!
