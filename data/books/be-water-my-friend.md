I've been a fan of [[Bruce Lee]] for as long as I can remember. My father was a big fan of Green Hornet when I was growing up. The only thing I remember from that show is the character [[Bruce Lee]] played: Kato. I had no idea what [[kung fu]] was. I had no idea who [[Bruce Lee]] was. But for me, he was the star of the show.

Last year I read [Bruce Lee: A Life by Matthew Polly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36415807-bruce-lee). It was an exceptional lens into the life of [[Bruce Lee]]. A life that was rich, inspiring, and one that ended far too early. It's hard not to be inspired by the things [[Bruce Lee]] accomplished in his short time on [[Earth]]. He achieved incredible mastery over who he was, a "human, fully expressed."

I have to admit, my admiration for [[Bruce Lee]] probably adds an extra star onto this review. [[Be Water, My Friend]] actually starts off quite strong. Shannon does a great job distilling written work from [[Bruce Lee]] and turning them into consumable chapters of [[self-help]] material. It's not all that surprising that the ideas aren't entirely original (what is these days?) as [[Bruce Lee]] talked strongly about taking ideas and turning them into your own. He appears to have been quite the master in that regard.

Shannon weaves many practical stories into the philosophical lessons throughout the book. Some come from [[Bruce Lee]]'s life and some come from here own. This is pretty common with [[self-help]] literature. I think it lends to the humanity behind the lessons and serves to drive the lessons home. The stories from [[Bruce Lee]]'s life certainly aren't as extensive as in [Matthew Polly's book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36415807-bruce-lee) but that shouldn't be expected.

The book loses a bit of momentum in the closing chapters. That being said, it was a quick, enjoyable read. I'm happy I picked it up because, like I mentioned, I'm bound to enjoy work related to [[Bruce Lee]]. It's been 47 years since he walked the [[Earth]] and he continues to influence people around the world.
