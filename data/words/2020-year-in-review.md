No matter where you spent your 2020, you're going to remember it. Together we battled [disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), [racism](https://blacklivesmatter.com/), and [murder hornets](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/just-how-dangerous-is-the-murder-hornet/). As if life isn't difficult enough, the universe piled on a lot of difficulty this year. But, like every year before, it's finally coming to a close.

This is my first time doing a yearly review but it feels like the right thing to do moving into another year. [Since I only have a finite number of them left](/life), I might as well make sure I'm living them the way I want to.

Even though 2020 brought on so many challenges, it might've been the best single year for my personal growth. I live with more **intention** than ever before; it was a theme that kept showing up. I spend more time doing what I wanted to do, what was best for me, and doing it all with more awareness.

## The pursuit of happiness

After releasing a [few](/projects/social-media-death-clock) [projects](/projects/wrabit) in 2019, I got pretty hooked on [finishing over starting](/words/what-not-how). Thanks to this feeling (and [plenty](https://twitter.com/sinequanonh) [of](https://www.indiehackers.com/) [inspiration](https://levels.io/)) I worked up the courage to quit my day job. Four years ago I proved to myself that I could make it as a software engineer. I went from self-taught to making $120k/year in that time. I became debt-free and was working at a [company that many people would recognize](https://www.cisco.com/).

But I didn't feel completely fulfilled.

Although I was proud of everything I accomplished in my career, my daily life wasn't rewarding. My daily work was draining me. When I built [Wrabit](/projects/wrabit) I took a week off of work and put my head down. I was productive. But not only that, I felt alive. Most of [Wrabit](/projects/wrabit) was built in that week and by the end of it, it was released. Once I released it, I couldn't look at my day job the same again.

It's a lot easier to complain about things you don't like than to act on them. My partner would likely tell you I complained about work a lot. Not because it was hard, or I wasn't making enough. I just didn't feel like I was being true to myself. So in March I decided to take the plunge. I quit my job [to build another product](/projects/bard), for my happiness, and my health.

[It didn't go exactly as I planned](/failures/2020-product-failures) but it made me feel fucking alive! Every moment of uncertainty was balanced with moments of pride, excitement, and coding flows. I learned about my weaknesses and some of my strengths. I **finished something I started**.

Quitting my job led to a journey of self-discovery that I'll forever be grateful for.

## The pursuit of knowledge

[After calling it quits on Bard](/failures/2020-product-failures), I needed to find the next stage in my life. The logical thing to do was start applying for jobs. I did apply for a few ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), I'm looking at you) but never found a new home. With job opportunities looking uncertain, I decided to chase another dream of mine. One I never believed I could accomplish.

I decided to commit full time to school.

While working at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/), I was already taking computer science classes. There was progress but it was incredibly slow. Taking a degree one class at a time turns out to be pretty painful. My partner decided to go back to school so I convinced myself to make another huge leap this year.

When I tell other students why I'm working on my computer science degree, they often seem confused. I'm thirty years old. I've already worked as a software engineer for four years. Why am I in school?

Those questions are valid. [As someone who never had the chance at university before](/failures/high-school), the reasons I'm getting a degree might be different than some of the younger computer science folks. I'm not here for a well-paying career.

I'm doing this to learn. You learn a lot working four years as a software engineerâ€”you learn a lot about what you don't know.

I'm doing this to level-up. I've had a few great opportunities but I want to work at world-class companies. Companies that are moving humanity forward.

I'm doing this to prove I can. This year I've spent a lot of time trying to love myself. Part of that practice means believing in myself. I always told myself I wasn't smart enough to go to university. I couldn't overcome the fact that [I dropped of out high school](/failures/high-school). Even though I always wanted to do this, I wouldn't let myself. Until 2020 nudged me in the right direction.

## The pursuit of me

My year of self-discovery taught me a lot about myself. How to forgive myself for my past, how to embrace my true self, and be unapologetically me. Although I'm not an expert at it, I get better every day. Everyone is aware that we are given [one life](/life) to live. Yet so many of us live our lives afraid to be who we are. In the end, **money is renewable** and **time is finite**. I've spent this year doing what I needed to do for myself and it's felt more rewarding than any year I can remember.

I plan to continue doing that into 2021 and beyond. I challenge you to do the same!

To close out, I'd like to list a few achievements I'm proud of this year.

- Quit my job to [build a product](/projects/bard)
- Built my website (the one you're on right now!)
- Committed to going to school full time
- [Gave a talk at React Vancouver](https://github.com/amorriscode/how-i-built-a-product-in-3-days)
- [Ran a half-marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/4273232292)
- Completed [Advent of Code 2020](https://github.com/amorriscode/advent-of-code-solutions)
- Exceeded my [2020 reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11621-2020-reading-challenge)

We should celebrate our victories more often, big and small. What're you proud of this year?
