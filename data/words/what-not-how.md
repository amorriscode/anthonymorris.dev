Over the last year I've launched a [couple](/projects/wrabit) [of](/projects/bard) [things](/projects/we-watch-tech). I adopted a mindset of finishing over starting. Before committing to finishing, I was the type of person to chase down new ideas left and right. It was hard to focus on one thing. There are just too many exciting things to build!

As a software engineer I enjoy reading about technological solutions. While building I want to do things _the right way_. Netflix solved **x** problem with **y** so that's how I should do it, right? Probably not.

One of the hardest thing for me during my year of building turned out to be avoiding _the right way_ entirely. My goal has been to launch products. To make things people would care about and _actually get them on the market_. That means I had to focus more on speed. What could I do to move faster as an indie hacker? Forget doing things for scale.

It doesn't seem like it should be hard but it was. It was hard for my [[ego]]. My ego wants me to think that if I don't do things the way FAANG software engineers do them then I'm an imposter.

When I was building [Bard](/projects/bard), there were a few times where I started to feel like an inadequate developer. I thought I would never be able to be considered _technical_ again. I didn't build out my own React app from scratch. I used [NextJS](https://nextjs.org). I still used containers but deployed them with [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). Every shortcut I took made me feel like a cheater.

Eventually I embraced the mentality. I'm working on a new project and it's built with [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com). The project is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I didn't even build my own CI/CD pipeline like I did with Bard. But I don't feel like a cheater anymore. I feel _empowered_.

I'm not only optimizing for _speed_ but _developer experience_ and _sanity_. My latest project (I'll write about it soon) has been a joy to build. The tools I'm using make me productive and happy. To me, that's more important than _the right way_.

Don't get me wrong, I still love reading about complex solutions. I still dream of a day when I might work at a big company making waves in software engineering. But while I'm at home working on products I hope people will love, I do things _the sane way_. I focus on the **what**, not the **how**.
