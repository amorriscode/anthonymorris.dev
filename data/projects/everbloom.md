Product ideas keep me up at night. There's so much opportunity to build software. A lot of those ideas are hard to justify building though. The market is too small, the revenue potential is non-existent. But I'm a strong believer that building to learn or for fun is just as valuable as building a product to earn an income off of.

everbloom is an app that I built for my mom and sister. It's helps you build a self-love practice by giving you a new affirmation every day. You speak the affirmation (or type it out) and then add an entry to your micro-journal. It's not something that is going to be bloated with features over time. It's free forever. I built it to help a few people who I love.

We're going to see a lot more small, personal software like everbloom. Vibe coding with Claude, Codex, or Cursor has made it easier than ever to make something for yourself or your friends. I can't wait to see people's imaginations come to life.
