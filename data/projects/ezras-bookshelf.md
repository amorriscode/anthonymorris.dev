A friend of mine send over an episode of The Ezra Klein Show discussing the future of AI. The podcast was great. At the end, the guest recommended a couple of books that sounded interesting to me. It turns out this happens at the end of every episode of the podcast.

I started searching around to see if there was a list of all the recommended books online. There had been many previous attempts from the [/r/ezraklein](https://reddit.com/r/ezraklein/) community but every single one of them was out of date. After taking a quick peek of the podcast's RSS feed, I realized this could be automated and I got to work.

This website is an opportunity for me to engage in a few things I love: design, code, and books. It also gave me a chance to get feedback from lovers of the podcast as they were excited by the website.

Shoutout to [The San Francisco Compute Company](https://sfcompute.com/) for the design inspiration.
