In 2019 I started to really thing about _why_ I code. What do I want to do with the knowledge I have obtained? It was clear to me that I wanted to use my abilities for good. On top of that, I wasn't feeling satisfied with my job.

I had recently finished building the [Social Media Death Clock](/projects/social-media-death-clock) and had a strong desire to keep building. I went back to the drawing board.

I found inspiration [750words.com](https://750words.com) and [The Artist's Way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way). There were similar solutions but none that quite fit my needs. Plus, I was itching to build.

The idea is that writing every day is beneficial to our mental health. If we are able to dump a stream of consciousness to the page, we will learn more about ourselves and feel better overall. I tried the practice with pen and paper and found it beneficial.

Just writing daily wasn't enough of a difference from existing solutions. I wanted Wrabit to be more than an exercise. My partner and I sat down one night and tried to think about ways to make it unique. In the end, I decided that I would charge for the product and donate portions of the user's monthly fees to mental health research.

When a user writers seven days in a row, $1 from their monthly fee is donated to the [Brain & Behavior Research Foundation](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/). Overall we have donated ~$500 to the foundation since launch!
