After all the craziness of 2020, I bet you were hoping 2021 would be smooth sailing. Nothing wild. Nothing unexpected.

Well, thanks to [/r/wallstreetbets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), January is wrapping up with some wild news. Retail investors have managed to push [$GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch) from roughly $37 per share to over $340 per share (at the time I'm writing this). The markets are closed so it's anyone's guess as to what happens over the next few days.

[It's an interesting story](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-mania-explained-how-the-reddit-retail-trading-crowd-ran-over-wall-street-pros.html), and not one I'm going to repeat here. I had a rough day and wanted to relax by building something just for the sake of building. So, I built a tool to help people calculate their lost gains.

If you didn't get in on [$GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME?p=GME&.tsrc=fin-srch), I'm sure there's still time for you to get on the rocket before it leaves for the moon. ðŸš€
