I really enjoy watching conference talks. There are so many great talks out there packed with useful information. I was starting to build up a decent list of talks I wanted to watch. But in 2020, I also started thinking about how I was engaging in content. If I was watching tech talks, I wanted to try to engage with the content more. I wanted to think deeper about them.

Enter [[We Watch Tech]].

One reason I love my personal website is because it allows me to write. [[We Watch Tech]] does the same but with a more technical focus. I watch tech talks and summarize them in an easy to understand way. If people prefer reading over watching videos, then [[We Watch Tech]] would be a good option for them!

I enjoy building things, working on design, and writing. [[We Watch Tech]] is just another space for me to play around with all of those things.
