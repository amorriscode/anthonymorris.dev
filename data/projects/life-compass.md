I'm a fan of productivity tools. The perfect tool must exist out there waiting to be found. I haven't found it.

With 2021 rolling in, I decided to try a new productivity tool: my own.

Since I'm capable of building web apps, I often fantasize about building products to solve every problem I have. There's no way I could do that effectively, so I'm not building this tool from scratch. Instead, I decided to build myself a [Notion](https://notion.so) template to manage my productivity.

The Life Compass is pretty simple. It has your bucket list, the big picture. Being productive on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis is great but what are you working toward?

You'll probably spend most of your time in the Yearly view. That's where the magic happens. You manage your current to do list, your weekly habits, and your calendar.

The Life Compass template isn't perfect. But it works. So we'll see how long this lasts before I give up and try some other tool (or build one myself!).
