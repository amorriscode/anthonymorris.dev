It's become apparent to me that I like [lists of things](/projects/ezras-bookshelf]. Sometime in 2024 I started to develop a list of interesting AI companies. When I'm bored I'll just click on their websites, try their products, or watch their demos. I realized that other people would probably be interested in the list too so I threw the companies in Airtable, embedded it in a simple website, and deployed the app.

After launching the app, I realized there might be an opportunity to make a small amount of income with sponsored ads/jobs. After throwing up a form to collect inbound leads I made my first sale within ~2 days!
