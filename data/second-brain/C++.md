[[Computer Science]] [[Programming Language]]

# C++
- Designed by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at AT&T [[Bell Labs]] in [[1980]]
- A combination of procedural and [[object-oriented programming]]
- Originally called '[[C]] with classes'

## Design Principles
- Designed to give the flexibility and procedural languages with high-level programming techniques of [[object-oriented programming]]
- Makes programming more enjoyable for serious programmers
- General-purpose [[programming language]] that is a superset of [[C]]
- Supposed [[object-oriented programming]] basics
	- Data abstraction, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Supports generic programming
	- A single program can cover many implementations
