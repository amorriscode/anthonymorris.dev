# Transistor

![Basic connection of a transistor](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-17-59-04.png)

- Invented at [[Bell Labs]] in [[1947]]
- Device that acts either:
  - Wire conducting [[electricity]]
  - [[Resistor]] that blocks the flow of [[electricity]]
  - Depends on voltage level of an input signal
- No moving parts
- Acts like a switch
  - Either on or off
  - Takes a few nanoseconds to switch states
- Made of a [[semiconductor]] material
  - Usually [[silicon]]
- Smaller than vacuum tubes and require less energy to operate
- Three terminals
  - Source
    - Usually the output line
    - Source signal pulled to ground --> output signal is low
    - Source signal remains high --> output signal is high
  - Base
    - Regulates a gate determining whether source and ground connect
    - Base signal high --> source signal grounded
    - Base signal low --> source signal high
  - Emitter
    - Typically connected to ground
