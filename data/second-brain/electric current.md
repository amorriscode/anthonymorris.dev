# Electric Current
- The flow of electric charge in an [[electric circuit]]
## Direct current
- Current only flows one direction
- Comes from batteries, solar panels, fuel cells, USB ports, etc.
## Alternating current
- Current flow is reversed in a repeating cycle
	- 60 Hz in the US
- Comes from wall outlets and the power grid
- Used to power homes/buildings because
	- Easy to transmit over long distances with low energy loss
		- Transformers step voltage up/down
	- Generators for AC are simpler and more efficient
