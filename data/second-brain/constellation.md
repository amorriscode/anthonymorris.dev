# Constellation

- Sectors of the sky, similar to provinces or states
- 88 sectors in total
- Named after [[Greek]] star patterns that lie within them
- Used as a guide for orienting yourself

## Changing In The Sky

- [[Sun]] prevents us from seeing half of the sky
- Since [[Earth]] goes around the [[Sun]], the visible part of the sky changes
  - This means we won't see the same constellations all the time
