# Uncertainty
- Degree of precision a value can be stated
	- Precision of a measurement process
- Numbers with more digits to the right of a decimal indicate _more_ precision
	- --> less uncertainty
- How finely was a measurement taken?

## Examples
- 123 is precise up to the unit place
	- Could be 122.5 rounded up or 123.4 rounded down
- 120 is precise to the tens place
	- Last digit is zero (not a [[significant digit]])
	- Could be anything from 1225 to 124.9 depending on how the measurement/rounding process is done
