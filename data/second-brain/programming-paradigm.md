# Programming Paradigm

- [[Programming]] patterns

## Imperative Paradigm

- Influenced by the [[von Neumann architecture]] and the model of executing sequential instructions
- Program describes processing necessary to solve the problem
- Characterized by:
  - Sequential execution of instructions
  - Use of variables that represent memory locations
  - Use of assignment statements that change the values of those variables
- [[Programming language]]s
  - [[FORTRAN]]
  - [[BASIC]]
  - [[C]]
  - [[Pascal]]
  - [[Cpp]] (C++)

### Procedural Paradigm

- Statements are grouped into subprograms
- Program is a hierarchy of subprograms
- Each subprogram performs a specific task necessary to the solution of the overall program

### Object-Oriented Paradigm

- A world interacting with objects
- Each object has responsibility for its own actions
- Objects are considered active
  - The code that manipulates them are bundled together
  - Objects are responsible for their own manipulation
- [[Programming language]]s
  - [[Java]]
  - [[Python]]

## Declarative Paradigm

- Results are described but the steps to accomplish the results are not stated

### Functional Model

- Based on mathematical concept of functions
- Computation is expressed in terms of the evaluation of functions
- Solution is expressed in terms of function calls
- [[Programming language]]s
  - [[Lisp]]

### Logic Programming

- Based on principles of symbolic logic
- Comprises a set of facts about objects and a set of rules about relationships among the objects
- Program consists of asking questions about these objects and their relationships
