# [[History]] of Computing

- Abacus
  - Record number values
- Important [[people]]
  - [[Blaise Pascal]]
  - [[Joseph Jacquard]]
  - [[Charles Babbage]]
  - [[Ada Lovelace]]
  - [[Alan Turing]]
- Harvard Mark I, ENIAC, UNIVAC I
  - Early computers
  - Launched new era of maths, physics, engineering, and economics

## Hardware

### First Generation Hardware (1951-1959)

- Vacuum tubes
  - Large
  - Not reliable
  - Lots of heat
- Magnetic drum
  - Memory device that rotated under read/write head
  - When memory cell was under head, data could be read/written
  - Very manual
- Card readers --> magnetic tape drives
  - Card readers that read holes punched in a card
  - Sequential auxiliary storage devices
  - Audio cassettes

### Second Generation Hardware (1959-1965)

- [[Transistor]]
  - Replaced vacuum tube
  - Fast, small, durable, cheap
  - Nobel prize was rewarded for invention
- Magnetic cores
  - Replaced magnetic drums
  - Information is available instantly
  - [[CPU]] no longer has to wait for drum to get to proper place to read/write
- Magnetic disks
  - Replaced magnetic tape
  - Data accessed directly
  - Faster because you can refer to location of data

### Third Generation Hardware (1965-1971)

- Integrated [[circuit]]s
  - Replaced [[circuit]] boards
  - Smaller, cheaper, faster, more reliable
  - Solid silicon containing [[transistor]]s and other components
  - Boards were printed
- [[Transistor]]s
  - Now used for memory construction
  - One [[transistor]] = one bit of information
- Terminal
  - Input/output device with keyboard and screen
  - Direct access to [[computer]] + immediate response

### Fourth Generation Hardware (1971-Present)

- Large-scale integration (LSI)
  - Great advances in chip tech
- PCs, commercial market, workstations
  - [[Computer]]s become affordable
  - Huge companies like Apple, Sun, Dell, etc.
- Laptops, tablets, and smart phones
  - A [[computer]] in everyone's hands
- [[Parallel computing]]
- [[Networking]]
  - Ethernet used to connect [[computer]]s
  - Resources can be shared over the network
- [[Cloud computing]]
  - Use of [[computer]] resources on the [[Internet]]

## Software

### First Generation Software (1951-1959)

- [[Machine language]]
  - [[Computer]] programs written in binary
- [[Assembly language]]s and translators
  - Programs written using mnemonics
  - Mnemonics get translated to machine code
- Programmers split into two groups
  - Application programmers
  - Systems programmers

### Second Generation Software (1959-1956)

- High level [[programming language]]s
  - Made programming easier
  - [[FORTRAN]], [[COBOL]], [[Lisp]]

### Third Generation Software (1965-1971)

- Systems software
  - Humans were too slow
  - Put [[computer]] resources under control of the _[[computer]]_
    - [[Operating system]]s decide what to run and when
- Separation between users and hardware
  - Software is being written for general public

### Fourth Generation Software (1971â€“1989)

- Structured programming
  - [[Pascal]]
  - C++ ([[cpp]])
- New application software for users
  - Spreadsheets
  - Word processors
  - DBMS

### Fifth Generation Software (1990-Present)

- Microsoft dominates the market
- OOP ([[object oriented programming]])
  - Hierarchy of data objects
  - [[Java]], etc.
- World Wide Web
- New users
  - Don't need [[computer]] knowledge to benefit

## Computing as a Discipline

- What can be _efficiently_ automated?
  - Four necessary skills:
    - Algorithmic thinking
      - Express problems in terms of step-by-step procedures
    - Representation
      - Store data in a way it can be process efficiently
    - [[Programming]]
      - Algorithmic thinking + Representation --> [[computer]] software
    - Design
      - Software that serves a purpose
