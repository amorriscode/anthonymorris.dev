# Mass-Luminosity Relation

![Mass-Luminosity Relation](/assets/second-brain/2021-01-24-16-00-40.png)

- The more massive [[star]]s are generally the more luminous
- [[Luminosity]] varies as the fourth power of the [[mass]]
- Can be used to find the distance to [[binary star]] systems

## Formula

- $\frac{L}{L_{sun}} = (\frac{M}{M_{sun}})^a$
  - $L_{sun}$ and $M_{sun}$ are the [[luminosity]] and [[mass]] of the [[Sun]]
  - $1 < a < 6$
