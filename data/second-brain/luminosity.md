# Luminosity

- Total amount of [[energy]] emitted by an object per second
- Measured in Joules per second or [[Watt]]s
- Independent of distance
  - E.g. a 100W light bulb will always be 100W even if it doesn't appear like it because it's so far away
- [[Inverse square law]] causes apparent brightness of a source to weaken with distance
