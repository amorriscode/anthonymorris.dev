# Astronomy

- The study of the objects that lie beyond [[Earth]] and the process by which these objects interact with one another
  - My definition:
    The study of celestial objects beyond Earth and how they interact with one another.
- An _observational science_
  - Rarely setup traditional experiments
  - Any hypotheses must be tested by observing many samples of the objects being studies
  - We note how different samples vary
- [[Light]] is basically the only information we have access to

## Light-year

- Distance [[light]] travels during one year
- Fastest possible speed in the [[universe]]
- $9.46 \times 10^{12}$ kilometers
  - Since [[light]] travels at $3 x 10^5$ kilometers per second
