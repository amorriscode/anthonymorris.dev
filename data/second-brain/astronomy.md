# Astronomy

- The study of the objects that lie beyond [[Earth]] and the process by which these objects interact with one another
  - My definition:
    The study of celestial objects beyond Earth and how they interact with one another.
- An _observational science_
  - Rarely setup traditional experiments
  - Any hypotheses must be tested by observing many samples of the objects being studies
  - We note how different samples vary
- [[Light]] is basically the only information we have access to
