# Gravity

- Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere
- Gravitational attraction between two objects:
  - $F_{gravity} = G \frac{M_1M_2}{R^2}$
    - $F_{gravity}$ is the force of gravity between two objects
    - $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of two objects
    - $R$ is the separation of those objects
    - $G$ is the _universal gravitational constant_
