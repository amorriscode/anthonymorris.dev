# Gravity
- Quantified by [[Isaac Newton]]
  - [[universal law of gravitation]]
- Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere
- The strength of an object's gravitational pull is directly proportional to its mass
	- More massive --> stronger pull
	- Strength _decreases_ as the separation between two masses _increases_

## Universal Gravitational Constant
- $6.67 \times 10^{-11} m^3 / (kg s^2)$
