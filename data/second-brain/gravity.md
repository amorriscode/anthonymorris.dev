# Gravity

- Quantified by [[Isaac Newton]]
- Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere

## Formula

- Gravitational attraction between two objects
- $F_{gravity} = G \frac{M_1M_2}{R^2}$
  - $F_{gravity}$ is the force of gravity between two objects
  - $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of two objects
  - $R$ is the separation of those objects
  - $G$ is the _universal gravitational constant_

## Universal Gravitational Constant

- $6.67 \times 10^{-11} m^3 / (kg s^2)$
