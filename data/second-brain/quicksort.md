# Quicksort

![Quicksort animation](/assets/second-brain/.gif)

- Divide and conquer
- Divides a large list into smaller sub-lists
  - Low elements and high elements
- Recursively sorts the sub-lists
- Usually done in place with $O(log(n))$ stack space

## Complexity

| Average Time  | Space    |
| ------------- | -------- |
| $O(n log(n))$ | $log(n)$ |

## Process

- Pick an element to be the pivot point
- Partition
  - Reorder list
  - All elements with value less than pivot come before the pivot
  - All elements with value greater than pivot come after the pivot
  - Pivot is in its final position
- Recursively apply above steps to sub-list of elements with smaller values and greater values

## Implementation
