## [[astr-1101]]

- Learning objectives for reading section 2.2
  - Describe early examples of [[astronomy]] around the world
    - Egyptians
      - Used Sirius to track the year
        - It has a yearly cycle that corresponded with the flooding of the Nile
    - Chinese
      - Also had a calendar
      - Recorded many things like [[comet]]s, [[meteor]]s, and dark spots on the [[Sun]]
    - Mayans
      - Used [[Venus]] to build their calendar
  - Explain how [[Greek]] astronomers were able to deduce that [[Earth]] is spherical
    - Shadows on the [[Moon]] (during a lunar [[eclipse]]) made by the [[Earth]] are always round
      - Shadows that are _always_ round can only be made by spherical objects
    - As you travel south, you can see new [[star]]s
      - If [[Earth]] was flat, this wouldn't happen
  - Explain how [[Greek]] astronomers were able to calculate [[Earth]]â€™s size
  - Describe the motion of [[Earth]] called [[precession]]
  - Describe [[Ptolemy]]â€™s geocentric system of planetary motion ([[geocentric model]])
- Learning objectives for reading section 2.4
  - Explain how [[Copernicus]] developed the [[heliocentric model]] of [[the Solar System]]
  - Describe [[Galileo]]â€™s discoveries concerning the study of motion and forces
    - Showed that rest is no more natural than motion
    - Surmised that an object with no resistance that is in motion would stay in motion
      - Force is required to stop something from moving just as it is required to start moving something
    - Discovered uniform acceleration
      - Watched objects falling down ramps
  - Explain how [[Galileo]]â€™s discoveries tilted the balance of evidence in favor of the Copernican model ([[heliocentric model]])
    - Proved the [[Moon]] wasn't a perfect sphere (saw mountains/craters)
    - Built a [[telescope]] to help with observations
    - Discovered there could be centers of motion that are also in motion
      - Proof that the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] could keep up with it even if it was in motion
      - Found four moons revolving around Jupiter
      - Saw [[Venus]] go through phases just like the [[Moon]] so it must revolve around the [[Sun]] too
        - [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Venus]] phases didn't align with [[Galileo]]'s
