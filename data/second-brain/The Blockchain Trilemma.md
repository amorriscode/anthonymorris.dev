# The Blockchain Trilemma
- An evolution of [[CAP Theorem]]
	- Only two of the three guarantees can be provided by a distributed system:
		- Consistency
		- Availability
		- Partition tolerance
- Public blockchains must sacrifice either
	- Security
		- Inability to manipulate transactions
		- Inability to alter the the blockchain
	- Decentralization
		- Eg. decentralization reduces network throughput
	- Scalability
		- Network latency
