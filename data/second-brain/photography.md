## Spots in Vancouver
- Brothers Creek loop in West Vancouver: Some old growth further up the trail, one of the few places that gets fog.
- Lighthouse Park in West Vancouver: Some old growth on the trail down to the lighthouse. The lighthouse can be a good spot to watch the sunset.
- Kennedy Falls: A pretty long hike with a decent waterfall at the end. There is one old growth tree on the way, but it's fenced off.
- Crystal Falls in Lions Bay - A nice little waterfall next to the road
- Steelhead falls in Mission - A nice waterfall about an hour drive from Vancouver
- Cypress Falls - My favorite park in Vancouver but we will be going here on Sunday.Â 
- Wycliff park - An ok spot to shoot sunset
