# Creative Engineering with Mark Rober

- "How to build cool stuff and get people to care about it"
- [[Monthly]] class with [[Mark Rober]]
- Will end up with 3 builds

## Storytelling

- [[Mark Rober]] always makes builds motivated by great stories
- How do you make a video go viral?
  - Make people react
  - Strong emotions
    - Laughter, sadness, outrage, etc.
  - No one shares videos they don't remember
  - Story-driven development

## Engineering Design Process

1. Brainstorm
2. Research
3. Prototype
4. Final Build

### Brainstorm

- Process:
  1. Scenes
     - Where might you interact with the theme?
  2. Problems
     - What problems do you encounter in the scenes?
     - The more relatable the problem, the more it'll resonate
  3. Solutions
- When picking your problem/solution:
  - Is it relatable?
  - Is it inspiring to you?
  - Is it plot worthy?
  - Does it fit the constraints?

### Research

- Helps you stay organized and see the entire design space

#### Part One

- Find the requirements of your project
  - Constraints
  - Helps you focus your energy
  - Adds structure for you to solve problems
  - Can break them up into *essential* and *non-essential*
    - Some things will be out of scope but still worth capturing
- After you have requirements, you want to dive deeper into each of them and build them out
  - Look are examples in the real world that might have parallels
    - E.g. [[Mark Rober]] used grain silo [[patent]]s to build his [liquid sand hot tub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs)
  - Talk to friends and family
    - Collaboration always brings great ideas
- Keep track of experiments you'll need to perform as you go through the process
  - They will help drive your build
  - Science experiments that'll help guide your build
- Keep your ideas broad
  - Think big
  - You can explore the ideas later as you develop your build
  - Don't worry about things that are difficult/near impossible

#### Part Two

- Narrow down the potential approaches to your build
- Answer any open questions you had
  - Do your science experiments
  - Great addition to the story behind your build
  - Process:
    1. Define your question and variables
       - Test what happens when you change your variable
       - Test one thing at a time
    2. Get the materials
    3. Run the experiment and measure outcomes
    4. Analyze your data and form conclusions

## Misc

- Formula for determining speed based on iPhone slo mo
  - $\frac{5.4 \times distance(ft)}{slo mo time} = mph$
