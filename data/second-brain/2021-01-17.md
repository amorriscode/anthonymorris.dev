- [[Causation]]
- [[David Hume]]'s [[empiricism]]
  - [[Idea]]s vs Impressions
    - Two kinds of impressions
      - Sense impressions
      - Impressions coming from introspection
  - All our ideas are copied from our impressions
  - Cause and effect is a tricky one for [[David Hume]]
    - What exactly do we *see* when observing a causal process?
    - We don't see any "force" or "power" that causes effects
  - Hume says we *do* experience
    - That cause and effect are **contiguous** in space and time
    - Causes occur prior to their effects
    - There is a necessary connection between cause and effect
      - Cannot have the cause without the effect
      - But how do we experience a necessary connection?
  - Hume's theory of causation is known as [[regularity theory]]
- *All* theories of causation accept that there are many regularities in the world, and that they have something to do with cause and effect
- [[Elizabeth Anscombe]]
  - Responded to [[David Hume]]'s ideas on [[causation]]
    - [[Causation]] doesn't imply necessitation
      - It can cause $B$ without necessitating $B$
    - Necessity is a logical consequence, relative to the laws of [[physics]]
      - Not a subjective relation that only exists in our [[mind]]s
