[[Alice Zhao]] was mentioning how we have been really [[future-focused]] lately. It's so easy to get caught up trying to be productive. We constantly feel like we aren't enough. That we don't have enough. That we need new goals.

Goals are fine. Working towards bigger things is fine. But we have to be [[present]].

There's a fantastic quote that is (apparently) by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He says "it's not the destination, it's the journey." I often forget about the journey because I'm busy looking at the destination through binoculars.

Thankfully I have people like [[Alice Zhao]] to bring me back down to Earth.
