# Stars

## Distance from the [[Earth]]

1. [[Parallax]]
   - Limited to ~400 [[light-year]]s
2. Using brightness measurements
   - Look at the star, determine it's color spectrum (good indication of it's actual brightness)
   - Compare the actual brightness with the apparent brightness, they can determine the Distance
     - It's apparent brightness will be dimmer
