## [[astr-1101]]

- Learning objectives for reading section 2.2
  - Describe early examples of [[astronomy]] around the world
    - Egyptians
      - Used Sirius to track the year
        - It has a yearly cycle that corresponded with the flooding of the Nile
    - Chinese
      - Also had a calendar
      - Recorded many things like [[comets]], [[meteors]], and dark spots on the [[Sun]]
    - Mayans
      - Used [[Venus]] to build their calendar
  - Explain how [[Greek]] astronomers were able to deduce that [[Earth]] is spherical
    - Shadows on the [[Moon]] (during a lunar [[eclipse]]) made by the [[Earth]] are always round
      - Shadows that are _always_ round can only be made by spherical objects
    - As you travel south, you can see new stars
      - If [[Earth]] was flat, this wouldn't happen
  - Explain how [[Greek]] astronomers were able to calculate [[Earth]]â€™s size
    - In Syene, the [[Sun]] was straight overhead (no shadows created) but in Alexandria had shadows with 7Ëš
    - This means at Alexandria, [[Earth]]'s surfaced has curved by 7Ëš (1/50 of a full circle)
    - The distance between the two cities must then be 1/50 the [[Earth]]'s circumference, so we can measure that

  - Describe the motion of [[Earth]] called precession
    - The wobble of the [[Earth]]
    - Similar to a top wobbling
  - Describe [[Ptolemy]]â€™s geocentric system of planetary motion
    - It was overly complex
      - Lack of understanding led to things like an equant point
    - Predicted positions of planets for any date and time
    - All orbits were circular
    - Retrograde motion had to be explained in a unique way since [[Earth]] was not moving
      - Planets revolved in their own epicycles
      - Those epicycles revolved around [[Earth]]
- Learning objectives for reading section 2.4
  - Explain how [[Copernicus]] developed the [[heliocentric model]] of [[the Solar System]]
    - He realized many of the observed motions in the sky could be explained by the [[Earth]] moving around the [[Sun]] while rotating
      - The motion of the [[Sun]]
      - The rotation of the [[celestial sphere]] (the [[Earth]] rotates, not the sphere)
  - Explain the Copernican model of planetary motion and describe evidence or arguments in favor of it
    - Was able to explain retrograde motion by placing the [[Sun]] at the center
      - Planets move faster the closer they are to the [[Sun]]
    - It was less clumsy and had better symmetry than [[Ptolemy]]'s model
  - Describe [[Galileo]]â€™s discoveries concerning the study of motion and forces
    - Showed that rest is no more natural than motion
    - Surmised that an object with no resistance that is in motion would stay in motion
      - Force is required to stop something from moving just as it is required to start moving something
    - Discovered uniform acceleration
      - Watched objects falling down ramps
  - Explain how [[Galileo]]â€™s discoveries tilted the balance of evidence in favor of the Copernican model
    - Proved the [[Moon]] wasn't a perfect sphere (saw mountains/craters)
    - Built a telescope to help with observations
    - Discovered there could be centers of motion that are also in motion
      - Proof that the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]] could keep up with it even if it was in motion
      - Found four moons revolving around Jupiter
      - Saw [[Venus]] go through phases just like the [[Moon]] so it must revolve around the [[Sun]] too
        - [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Venus]] phases didn't align with [[Galileo]]'s
