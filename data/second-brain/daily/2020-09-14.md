[[astr-1101]]

- First rule of astronomy: don't look at the [[Sun]]
  - Our [[eyes]] don't have pain receptors
    - You may squint but won't feel pain
  - The [[Light]] can burn sensors on the back of the eye
  - You brain will do its best to fill in any damaged areas from looking at the [[Sun]]
    - Once there is too much damage, you'll start to notice the effects
