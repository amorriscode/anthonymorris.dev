# Exoplanet

- Planets outside of [[the Solar System]]
- Difficult to find due to the brilliant glare of the [[star]]s they [[orbit]]
  - Indirect observation is best for detection
- Thousands of exoplanets have been catalogued
  - Most are far more massive or larger in size than [[Earth]]
    - Smaller [[planet]]s are simply harder to detect
    - Smaller [[planet]]s are actually *more* common than larger [[planet]]s

## Detection Techniques

- [[Doppler spectroscopy]]
- [[Transit Method]]

## Exoplanet Discovery Missions

- [[James Webb Space Telescope]]
- [[TESS]]
- [[Kepler Space Telescope]]
- [[HETE-2]]
