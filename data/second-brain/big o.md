# Big O

- Expresses computing time as the term in a function that increases most rapidly to the size of a problem
- How fast an algorithm is
  - Rate of growth of operations
  - How the running time will increase as the input increases
- Worst-case run time
- _Can we do better?_

## Common Run Times

- Fastest --> slowest

| Big O              | Name                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| $O(1)$             | constant/bounded time      |
| $O(log \; n)$      | log time                   |
| $O(n)$             | linear time                |
| $O(n \; log \; n)$ | $n \; log \; n$ time       |
| $O(n^2)$           | quadratic/exponential time |
| $O(2^n)$           | exponential time           |
| $O(n!)$            | factorial time             |
