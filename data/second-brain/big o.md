# Big-O
- Analysis of an algorithm's efficiency
- Rate of growth of operations
	- How the runtime or space increases as the input increases
- Big-O is a measurement of the worst case
## Rules
- Ignore constants
	- Values that don't scale with the input
- Ignore low-order terms
## Common Run Times
- Fastest --> slowest

| Big O              | Name                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| $O(1)$             | constant/bounded time      |
| $O(log \; n)$      | log time                   |
| $O(n)$             | linear time                |
| $O(n \; log \; n)$ | $n \; log \; n$ time       |
| $O(n^2)$           | quadratic/exponential time |
| $O(2^n)$           | exponential time           |
| $O(n!)$            | factorial time             |
