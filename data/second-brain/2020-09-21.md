[[astr-1101]]
- Checked out [[Stellarium]] which is awesome but is harder to use than Starry Sky
- Looking at [[gravity]] and [[orbit]]s

[[cpsc-1480]]
- Chapter 3 reading
  - Addressing on networks
- Lecture outcomes
  - Distinguish analog vs digital
  - Explain [[compression]] and calculate compression ratios
  - Do text [[compression]]
  - Explain the nature of sound
  - Explain how RGB define color
  - Distinguish between raster/vector graphics [[Todo]]
  - Explain temporal/spatial video [[compression]]
- Data
  - Values or facts
  - Can be unstructured
  - Lack context
  - All data is stored as binary digits (bits)
- Information
  - Data organized and/or processed in a way that is useful in solving some kind of problem
- Analog vs digital
  - Analog --> infinite
    - Continuous representation
    - Analogous to actual information it represents
  - Digital --> finite
    - Computers are limited by memory
    - Represent _enough_ of the world to satisfy computational needs and our senses
    - Discrete representation
      - We can only represent data with `0`s and `1`s
    - Breaks up information in separate elements
- Electronic signals
  - Analog signal continually fluctuates in [[voltage]]
    - Alternating [[current]]
    - Bipolar
  - Digital signal has only high or low state
    - Corresponds to two [[binary]] digits
  - All electronic signals degrade as the move
  - [[Voltage]] signal fluctuates due to environmental effects
    - [[Electromagnetism]]
- Audio information
  - Digitized by:
    - Sampling --> periodically measure the [[voltage]]
      - 40,000 times per second
    - Quantization --> represent voltage as a number using finite number of bits
- Color depth
  - HiColor
    - 16 bits
  - TrueColor
    - 24 bits
