# Abductive Argument

- A theory is _probably_ true because the theory is the best that exists for the conclusion
- Compared to the alternatives the argument is best
- _Inference to the best explanation_
  - We conclude best available explanation of an observation is _probably_ true
  - It's the _best available explanation_, so it is true
- Many philosophers think scientific theories are commonly supposed by abduction
- Does not positively verify the conclusion
- Famous scientific examples
  - [[Charles Darwin]]'s Theory of [[Evolution]]
  - [[Albert Einstein]]'s Theory of [[Relativity]]
- "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." ~ [[Sherlock Holmes]]
