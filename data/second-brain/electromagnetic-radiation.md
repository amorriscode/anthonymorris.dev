# Electromagnetic Radiation

- Generated by processes at the atomic level
  - Changes in the way parts of an [[atom]] interact and move
- Forms of electromagnetic radiation are described by the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]
- Low energy --> low frequency
- High energy --> high frequency
- [[Particle]]s are [[photon]]s
- Types of radiation emitted by astronomical objects is determined by their temperature

| Type of Radiation    | Wavelength Range (nm) | Radiated by Objects at This Temperature | Typical Sources                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Gamma Rays]]       | Less than 0.01        | More than $10^8$ K                      | Nuclear reactions                                              |
| [[X-rays]]           | 0.01-20               | $10^6-10^8$ K                           | Gas clusters in [[galaxies]], supernova remnants, solar corona |
| [[Ultraviolet Rays]] | 20-400                | $10^4-10^6$ K                           | Supernova remnants, very hot stars                             |
| Visible [[light]]    | 400-700               | $10^3-10^4$ K                           | Stars                                                          |
| [[Infrared]]         | $10^3-10^6$           | $10-10^3$ K                             | Cool clouds of dust and gas, planets, moons                    |
| [[Microwaves]]       | $10^6-10^9$           | Less than 10 K                          | Active [[galaxies]], pulsars, [[cosmic background radiation]]  |
| [[Radio Waves]]      | More than $10^9$      | Less than 10 K                          | Supernova remnants, pulsars, cold gas                          |
