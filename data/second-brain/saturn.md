# Saturn â™„

- 10 AU from the [[Sun]]
- Takes nearly 30 years to [[orbit]] the [[Sun]]
- Low density ($0.7 g/cm^3$)
  - Light enough to float in water (less dense)
    - Although it isn't solid so it wouldn't _actually_ float
  - Lowest of any [[planet]]

## Moons

- 62 known [[moon]]s
- Members:
  - [[Titan]]
  - [[Enceladus]]

## [[Ring System]]

- Very thin
  - 270 million metres x 20 m
- Collisions act to smooth everything out
- Icy rocks
  - Typically the size of ping-pong balls, [[tennis]] balls, and basketballs
- Some gaps from [[moon]]s
- It's unlikely the rings were a destroyed [[moon]]
- Being close to Saturn's tidal forces prevents the formation of larger bodies
- E ring appears to be continually replenished by [[Enceladus]]
