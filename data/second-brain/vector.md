# Vector

- Quantities with
  - *Direction*
    - Angle
    - Can be larger than 90Ëš
  - *Magnitude*
    - $|\vec{V}|$
    - Always positive
      - A minus sign tells us about its direction
- Vectors have *components* not *coordinates*

## Unit Vectors

- i hat
  - $x$ component
- j hat
  - $y$ component

## Adding Vectors

- Resultant displacement vector ($\vec{D}_R$) is the sum of the vectors
  - A vector equation
  - $\vec{D}_R = \vec{D}_1 + \vec{D}_2$
- The resultant vector is not equal to the sum of the magnitudes of two separate vectors, it is smaller than their sum
  - $\vec{D}_R \leq \vec{D}_1 + \vec{D}_2$
- Adding vectors is *commutative*
  - $\vec{V}_1 + \vec{V}_2 = \vec{V}_2 + \vec{V}_1$

$\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \begin{bmatrix}Ax\\Ay\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}Bx\\By\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}Ax + Bx\\Ay + By\end{bmatrix}$

### Tail-to-Tip Method

1. Draw on vector ($\vec{D}_1$) to scale
2. Draw second vector ($\vec{D}_2$) to scale, placing its tail at the tip of the first vector
   - Make sure its direction is correct!
3. Draw an arrow from the tail of $\vec{D}_1$ to the tip of $\vec{D}_2$
   - This arrow represents the sum (*resultant*) of the two vectors
   - The length of the resultant represents its magnitude
