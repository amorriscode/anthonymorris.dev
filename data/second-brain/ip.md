# IP (Internet Protocol)

- Operates at the [[network layer]]
  - Specifies where data should be delivered
  - Identifies the data's source and destination [[IP address]]es
- Enables [[TCP]]/IP to internetwork to traverse:
  - More than one [[LAN]] segment
  - More than one type of network through router
- Unreliable, connectionless
  - Does not guarantee delivery of data
  - No session established before data is transmitted
  - Depends on [[TCP]]:
    - To ensure messages are put back together in proper order
    - To ensure each message reaches the correct application on receiving host
