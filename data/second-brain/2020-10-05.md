[[astr-1101]]

- [[Light]]
  - Important since that is all [[astronomer]]s can use to get information from [[space]]
- Chapter 5.1 - The Behaviour of [[Light]]
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Explain the evidence for Maxwellâ€™s electromagnetic model of light
    - Describe the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of light
    - Discuss the particle model of light and the definition of photon
    - Explain how and why the amount of light we see from an object depends upon its distance
- Chapter 5.2 - The [[Electromagnetic Spectrum]]
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Understand the bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and how they differ from one another
    - Understand how each part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] interacts with [[Earth]]â€™s atmosphere
    - Explain how and why the [[light]] emitted by an object depends on its temperature
- Chapter 5.3 - [[Spectroscopy]] in [[Astronomy]]
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Describe the properties of [[light]]
    - Explain how astronomers learn the composition of a gas by examining its spectral lines
    - Discuss the various types of spectra
- Chapter 5.4 - Structure of the [[Atom]]
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Describe the structure of [[atom]]s and the components of nuclei
    - Explain the behavior of [[electron]]s within [[atom]]s and how [[electron]]s interact with [[light]] to move among energy levels
- Chapter 5.5 - Formation of Spectral Lines
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Explain how emission line spectra and absorption line spectra are formed
    - Describe what ions are and how they are formed
    - Explain how spectral lines and ionization levels in a gas can help us determine its temperature
- Chapter 5.6 - The [[Doppler Effect]]
  - **Learning objectives**
    - Explain why the spectral lines of photons we observe from an object will change as a result of the objectâ€™s motion toward or away from us
    - Describe how we can use the [[Doppler effect]] to deduce how fast astronomical objects are moving through space
