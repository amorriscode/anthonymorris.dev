# Mars â™‚

- Valles Marineris
  - Mariner Valley
  - Complex system of canyons
  - As long as the [[United States]] is wide
- Eccentricity of Mars' [[orbit]] is 0.1
  - Nearly indistinguishable from a circle
  - See [[planetary motion]]
- Has evidence of habitable conditions in the past
- 1.52 AU from the [[Sun]]
- Diameter of 6790 km
  - Just over half of [[Earth]]'s diameter
  - Total surface area is close to the land area of [[Earth]]
- No magnetic field in present day
- Red colouring comes from [[iron]] oxides in the soil
- Polar caps
  - Visible by the unaided [[eye]]
- Mars has qualities like [[Earth]]
  - Sidereal day is 24 hours 37 minutes 23 seconds
  - Tilted 25Ëš
  - Experiences seasons lasting ~6 [[Earth]] months
- Possibility for past life
  - Thin [[atmosphere]] exists
    - Would've been thicker in the past
  - Existence of liquid [[water]]
- Experienced extensive volcanic activity at the same time [[the Moon]] did

## Atmosphere

- Less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure of [[Earth]]
- Components
  - 95% [[carbon dioxide]]
  - 3% [[nitrogen]]
  - 2% [[argon]]
- Gas proportions are similar to [[Venus]] but there is a lot less of each gas
- Thin atmosphere
- Low [[greenhouse effect]]
  - Runaway refrigerator effect

## Surface

### Polar Caps

- Seasonal caps are composed of frozen [[carbon dioxide]] (dry ice)
- Permanent or residual caps are composed of frozen [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] ice

### Water Features

- Runoff channels
  - Look like what [[geologist]]s would expect from surface runoff of ancient rain storms
  - Hint at a very different climate than we see today
- Outflow channels
  - Much larger than runoff channels
  - Possibly carved by huge volumes of running water
- Gullies
  - Erosional features that look to be caused by running [[water]]

## [[Moon]]s

- [[Phobos]] and [[Deimos]] are probably captured [[asteroid]]s
- Members:
  - [[Phobos]]
  - [[Deimos]]
