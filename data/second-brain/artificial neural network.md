# Artificial Neural Network
- [[Computer]] representation of [[knowledge]] that attempts to mimic neural networks of the [[human]] [[body]]
- A class of mathematical expression that take inputs (data and neural network weights) and the output are the "predictions" or loss function
- Training a neural net is the process of adjusting weights and threshold values to minimize a loss function

## Comparison to the human neural network
- Input values --> [[dendrite]]s
- Weight values --> Signals passed by [[dendrite]]s
- Computation and use of threshold value --> [[neuron]] producing a strong signal if enough of the weighted input signals are strong
