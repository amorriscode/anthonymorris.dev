## The Visual System

- [[Light]] reflects off objects and enters the eye
- The [[lens]] of the eye focuses the [[light]] as it strikes the back of the eye
- Cones and rod cells react to the [[light]] that strikes them
- Reactions are interpreted by our visual system and brain
  - Allows us to see objects
