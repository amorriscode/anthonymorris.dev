# Binary Star

- Two [[star]]s that [[orbit]] each other
  - Bounds together by [[gravity]]
  - Both [[star]]s [[orbit]] between a point, the center of [[mass]]
- [[Mass]] can be calculated from measurements of their [[orbit]]s

## Types of Binary Star Systems

- **Visual binary**
  - A binary star system where both [[star]]s can be seen with a [[telescope]]
- **Spectroscopic binary**
  - Appears as a single [[star]] when photographed or seen through a [[telescope]] but [[spectroscopy]] shows a binary [[star]] system

## Masses of Binary Star Systems

- Can be estimated using [[isaac newton]]'s reformulation of [[Johannes Kepler]]'s third law of [[planetary motion]]
  - If two objects are in mutual revolution, then the period ($P$) with which they go around each other is related to the semi-major axis ($D$) of the [[orbit]] of one with the respect to the other
  - $D^3 = (M_1 + M_2)P^2$
    - $D$ is in astronomical units
    - $P$ is measured in years
    - $M_1 + M_2$ is the sum of the masses of the two [[star]]s in units of the [[Sun]]'s [[mass]]
