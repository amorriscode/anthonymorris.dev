# Light

- Can act as a [[particle]] or a [[wave]] ([[wave-particle duality]])
- [[Wavelength]]
  - Determines colour
- [[Frequency]]
  - Cycles per unit of [[time]]
- [[Speed]]
  - $c \; = \lambda f$
  - Light travels at $3 x 10^8 m/s$
- Light is additive
- Used to make observations in [[astronomy]]

## Visible Light

- Part of [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to which our eyes are sensitive
- What _humans_ can see
- ROYGBIV
  - Red
  - Orange
  - Yellow
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Indigo
  - Violet
- Large [[wavelength]] (R) --> small [[wavelength]] (V)
- Small [[frequency]] (R) --> large [[frequency]] (V)

## Speed of Light

- $3 \times 10^5 km/s$
- First sign that light's [[speed]] was finite came in [[1675]]
  - [[Ole RÃ¸mer]] observed [[eclipse]]s of [[Jupiter]]'s moons
    - Noticed the [[eclipse]]s happened at times different than predicted
      - Earlier than predicted at opposition
      - Later than predicted at conjunction
    - Since the distance between opposition/conjunction is different, [[speed]] of light must be have an impact
- Takes ~8.3 minutes for light to get from the [[Sun]] to [[Earth]]
  - 1 AU --> takes light 8 minutes to travel
