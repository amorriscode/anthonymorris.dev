# Light

- Can act as a particle or a wave ([[wave-particle duality]])
- [[Wavelength]]
  - $\lambda$
  - Distance between two successive crests
  - Determines colour
- Frequency
  - $f$
  - Herz
  - Cycles per unit of time
- Speed
  - $c \; = \lambda f$
  - Light travels at $3 x 10^8 m/s$
- Light is additive

## Visible Light

- Part of [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to which our eyes are sensitive
- What _humans_ can see
- ROYGBIV (large --> small [[wavelength]])
  - Violet
  - Indigo
  - Blue
  - Green
  - Yellow
  - Orange
  - Red

## Speed of Light

- $3 \times 10^5 km/s$
- First sign that light's speed was finite came in [[1675]]
  - [[Ole RÃ¸mer]] observed [[eclipse]]s of [[Jupiter]]'s moons
    - Noticed the [[eclipse]]s happened earlier/later than predicted at opposition/conjunction
    - Since the distance between opposition/conjunction is different, speed of light must be have an impact
- Takes ~8.3 minutes for light to get from the [[Sun]] to [[Earth]]
  - 1 AU --> takes light 8 minutes to travel
