# Personal Identity

- How we identify someone over time
- Questions
  - What makes a person the same person from one moment to the next?
  - What makes us ourselves?
- We care about [[numerical identity]] not [[qualitative identity]]

## Theories

### The Soul Theory

- *You* are your soul
- Two objections:
  - Asserts numerical identity over time but doesn't explain it
  - No clear identity conditions even at a given time
    - Do we really understand what makes one soul different from other souls?

### Spatiotemporal Continuity Theory

- An object is identified in terms of a continuous series of locations in space and time
- *You* are something that inhabits a continuous series of locations in space and time
- Does it really give us a philosophical account of personal identity?
- Objection: Prince and Cobbler thought experiment
  - Brain transfer swap
    - Prince commits a crime then gets a mad scientist to swap his brain with the Cobbler's
    - Prince is now in the Cobbler's body
    - Cobbler (inside the Prince's body) is punished
  - No transfer swap
    - Same as above but the scientist just alters the existing brain's
  - [[John Locke]] concludes that personal identity follows psychological continuity, not spatiotemporal continuity
- [[John Locke]] on personal identity
  - Personal identity consists in sameness of consciousness
    - Consciousness is inseparable from thinking
    - One distinguishes between oneself and other thinking beings via thought
  - A person's identity stretches back in time as far as one's thought extends

### Brain-Based Psychological Continuity Theory

- A past person is the same as a future person if and only if:
  - The two persons are psychologically continuous with each other
  - The brains of the two people are spatiotemporally continuous with each other

## Split Brain Cases

    - *X*'s brain is split into two halves
      - Two spatiotemporally distinct individuals, *Y* and *Z*, are formed
    - Is *X* the same individual as *Y*, *Z*, both, or neither?
    - [[Derek Parfit]]'s response
      - Something wrong with the question
      - All that really matters for personal identity is psychological continuity

## [[David Hume]] on personal identity

- Human mind is composed of a bundle of impressions in rapid succession
- The mind is not identical over time
- We ascribe a unified personal identity to ourselves over time as follows:
  - We form ideas of [[identity]] and [[diversity]] via actions of the [[imagination]]
  - We slide from one idea to the other, because the corresponding actions resemble each other
  - We invent the fiction of a persisting self to mask our mistake
