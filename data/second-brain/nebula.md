# Nebula

- Cloud of [[interstellar medium]]

## Reflection Nebula

- "Newly" formed [[star]]s live in the material they were made from
  - The [[star]]s illuminate the [[interstellar medium]] around them
  - [[Light]] from these clouds is reflected [[light]] (like moonlight)
- Usually appears bluer than its illuminating [[star]]

## Dark Nebula

- [[Giant molecular cloud]]s that are cold and dense enough to block [[light]] coming from behind it
