# Sunspot

- Large, dark features seen on the surface of the [[Sun]]
- Caused by increased magnetic activity
  - The [[magnetic field]] lines are twisting due to [[differential rotation]]
  - The twisting creates knots which show up as sunspots
- Cooler than the surrounding areas of the sun
  - ~3800 K vs. ~5800 K
  - Still hotter than the surface of many [[star]]s
- Consist of two spots
  - Umbra
    - Inner dark core
  - Penumbra
    - Surrounding less dark region
- Can become bigger than [[Earth]]
