- Chapter 14 - Cosmic Samples and The Origins of [[the Solar System]]
  - 14.1 [[Meteor]]s
    - Learning Objectives
      - Explain what a [[meteor]] is and why it is visible in the night sky
      - Describe the origins of [[meteor shower]]s
  - 14.2 [[Meteorite]]s: Stones from [[Heaven]]
    - Learning Objectives
      - Explain the origin of [[meteorite]]s and the difference between a [[meteor]] and a [[meteorite]]
      - Describe how most [[meteorite]]s have been found
      - Explain how primitive stone [[meteorite]]s are significantly different from other types
      - Explain how the study of [[meteorite]]s informs our understanding of the age of [[the Solar System]]
  - 14.3 Formation of [[the Solar System]]
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the motion, chemical, and age constraints that must be met by any theory of [[solar system]] formation
      - Summarize the physical and chemical changes during the solar nebula stage of [[solar system]] formation
      - Explain the formation process of the terrestrial and giant [[planet]]s
      - Describe the main events of the further evolution of [[the Solar System]]
  - 14.4 Comparison With Other Planetary Systems
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe how the observations of protoplanetary disks provides evidence for the existence of other planetary systems
      - Explain the two primary methods for detection of [[exoplanet]]s
      - Compare the main characteristics of other planetary systems with the features of [[the Solar System]]
  - 14.5 Planetary Evolution
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the geological activity during the evolution of the [[planet]]s, particularly the [[terrestrial planet]]s
      - Describe the factors that affect differences in elevation on the [[terrestrial planet]]s
      - Explain how the differences in [[atmosphere]] on [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]] evolved from similar starting points in the early history of [[the Solar System]]
- Chapter 21 - The Birth of [[Star]]s and the Discovery of [[Planet]]s Outside [[the Solar System]]
  - 21.1 [[Star]] Formation
    - Learning Objectives
      - Identify the sometimes-violent processes by which parts of a molecular cloud collapse to produce [[star]]s
      - Recognize some of the structures seen in images of molecular clouds like the one in [[Orion]]
      - Explain how the environment of a molecular cloud enables the formation of [[star]]s
      - Describe how advancing waves of [[star]] formation cause a molecular cloud to evolve
  - 21.2 The H-R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution
    - Learning Objectives
      - Determine the age of a protostar using an H-R diagram and the protostar's [[luminosity]] and [[temperature]]
      - Explain the interplay between [[gravity]] and [[pressure]], and how the contracting protostar changes its position in the H-R diagram as a result
  - 21.3 Evidence that [[Planet]]s Form Around Other [[Star]]s
    - Learning Objectives
      - Trace the evolution of dust surrounding a protostar, leading to the development of rocky [[planet]]s and gas giants
      - Estimate the timescale for growth of [[planet]]s using observations of the disks surrounding young [[star]]s
      - Evaluate evidence for [[planet]]s around forming [[star]]s based on the structures seen in images of the circumstellar dust disks
  - 21.4 [[Planet]]s Beyond [[the Solar System]]: Search and Discovery
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the orbital motion of [[planet]]s in our solar system using [[Johannes Kepler]]'s laws of [[planetary motion]]
      - Compare the indirect and direct observational techniques for [[exoplanet]]
