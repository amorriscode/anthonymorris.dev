# CPU (Central Processing Unit)

- [[Arithmetic Logic Unit]] + [[Control Unit]]
  - Used so frequently together
  - Make up the CPU
- _n_-bit processor 
  - _n_ refers to number of bits in the CPU general registers
  - Two _n_-bit numbers can be added with a single instruction
  - Can also refer to the width of the address bus
    - Is the size of addressable memory, but not always
  - Can also refer to the width of the data bus
    - But not always
- Electronics of the CPU inherently recognize [[binary]] representations of commands
  - Doesn't need to consult a list of commands
  - CPU embodies the list in its design
- Each CPU has its own [[machine language]]
