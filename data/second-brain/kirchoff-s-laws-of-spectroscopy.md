- Every [[element]] has a finger print
  - They interact with [[light]] in their own way
- Either in absorption or emission, finger print or spectral lines are in the same place
  - Have the same [[wavelength]]s

1. A luminous solid, liquid, or dense gas emits light of all [[wavelength]]s
2. A low density, hot gas seen against a cooler background emits an emission spectrum
   - Looks all black, except for light being emitted
3. A low density, cool gas in front of a hotter source of a continuous spectrum creates an absorption spectrum
   - Full [[rainbow]] but stuff is being absorbed (certain [[wavelength]]s --> black)
