- Every [[element]] has a finger print
  - They interact with [[light]] in their own way
- Either in absorption or emission, finger print or spectral lines are in the same place
  - Have the same [[wavelength]]s

1. Solid, liquid, or dense gas will produce a continuous spectrum
2. Low-density gas will produce an emission spectrum
   - Looks all black, except for light being emitted
3. Light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, result will be an absorption spectrum
   - Full [[rainbow]] but stuff is being absorbed (certain [[wavelength]]s --> black)
