# Tree

- First node -->- **root**
- Node with no children --> **leaf**

## Binary Tree

- Each node can have at most two child nodes
- Unique path exists from root to every other node
  - Every node (except the root) has a single parent

## Binary Search Tree

- Same shape as a binary tree
- Value of any node is greater than value of any node in its left subtree
- Value of any node is less than value of any node in its right subtree
- Can recursively search for a node similar to binary search
