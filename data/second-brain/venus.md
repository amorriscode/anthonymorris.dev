# Venus ♀

- 0.72 AU from the [[Sun]]
- Goes through phases like the [[Moon]]
  - Discovered by [[Galileo]]
  - Helped prove that [[Venus]] didn't [[orbit]] [[Earth]]
- [[Orbit]]s the sun in 225 days
- Rotational period: 243 days
  - Measured by bouncing radar signals off the [[planet]]
  - Day is longer than a year!
- Spins east --> west
  - Backwards compared to most planets in [[the Solar System]]
  - Possibly caused by an early collision during the formation of [[the Solar System]]

## Atmosphere

- 96% [[carbon dioxide]]
- Covered by clouds
  - Reflect ~70% of the sunlight
  - Makes it harder to study from a distance
- Very dry
  - Absence of [[water]] is one important way it differs from [[Earth]]
- Huge troposphere
  - Region of [[convection]]
  - Extends up to at least 50 km
- About 90x the atmospheric pressure of [[Earth]]
  - Like being 1 km underwater

## Surface

- Surface is hot --> 730K (over 850˚ F)
  - Thanks to the runaway [[greenhouse effect]]
    - Worse than on the [[Earth]]
    - Produces more greenhouse gases
    - Since Venus has so much [[carbon dioxide]] the effect is almost a million times stronger than on [[Earth]]
  - Melting crust
- 75% of the surface consists of lowland lava plains
- Has persistent geological activity
  - Surface age is between 300 and 600 million years
- No plate tectonics
  - Weak mantle convection
