# Database Management System
- Combination of software and data made up of:
	- The physical [[database]]
		- Collection of files containing the data
	- The [[database]] engine
		- Software that supports access to and modification of [[database]] contents
	- The [[database]] schema
		- Specification of the logical structure of the data stored in the [[database]]
- Should have the following features:
	- Ability to store records in a file
	- Complex algorithms for indexing (support fast access)
	- Handle concurrent connections
	- Support committing and rolling back changes
	- Caching records
		- Sync the persistent and main-memory versions
		- Restore database to reasonable state upon system crash
	- Compiler/interpreter to translate queries to executable code on files
	- Query optimization
- Connection types
	- Embedded
		- Exclusive access to the database engine
	- Server-based
		- Shared with other programs
