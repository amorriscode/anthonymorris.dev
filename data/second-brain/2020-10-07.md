- Guiding questions
  - What does "omnipotent" mean?
    - Why might one think that it's impossible for something to be omnipotent?
      - 1. Super-heavy stone --> stone so heavy even [[God]] cannot move it
      - 2. If [[God]] exists he is able to produce a super-heavy stone
      - 3. If [[God]] is omnipotent he could move the heavy stone, thus a super-heavy stone is impossible
      - 4. If [[God]] exists, he is not able to make a super-heavy stone
      - 2 and 4 are conflicting implications --> theism must be false
    - What is [[St Thomas Aquinas]]' response to this objection?
      - Omnipotence needs a different definition
      - Omnipotent being --> able to bring about any _possible_ outcome
      - Omnipotent being --> cannot bring about an _impossible_ outcome (like a square circle)
  - Tensions
    - Why might one think omnipotence incompatible with omniscience?
      - If [[God]] were omniscient, he must already know how He is going to intervene to change history using his omnipotence
      - Because [[God]] knows, he cannot change his mind about intervention
      - Therefore, he is not omnipotent
    - Why might one think that omnipotence incompatible with omnibenevolence?
    - How might a theist respond to these puzzles?
  - What is the problem of evil?
    - What definition of [[God]] does the problem assume?
    - Can you reconstruct this problem as a deductively valid argument with "[[God]] doesn't exist" as its conclusion?
  - What are some inadequate responses to this argument?
    - Why are they inadequate?
  - What is a [[theodicy]]?
  - What are some theodicies given in response to the above [[argument]]?
    - Do any of them provide a compelling objection to the [[argument]]?
      - Why or why not?
  - Can you think of other possible theodicies?
- Omnipotent --> all-powerful
  - No limit to power
  - No limit to what an omnipotent being can do
