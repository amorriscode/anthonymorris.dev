# Gesture
- Movement between contours/forms/tones
- Detail is nothing without gesture
	- Gesture brings life to a figure
- Tell a story with body language
	- Exaggerate to tell a better story

## Quick Sketch
- Great way to practice gesture
- More about how it _feels_ vs how it looks
- Not meant to be a finished drawing

### Tips
- Look for the longest axis
- Use simple lines
	- C curve
	- S curve
	- I (straight line)
- Find the longest action line of the body
	- Connect head to toes
- Bendiness
	- Tension --> zig zag
	- Relaxed --> Flowing curve
- Asymmetry of the body
	- The body isn't symmetric, don't attempt to make it so
- Look for stretches and pinching
- Draw smart not fast
	- Simplify the figure down so you can draw it in the time you have
- Be careful not to make torsos too straight
	- Makes them feel very unrelaxed
- Make BIG lines
