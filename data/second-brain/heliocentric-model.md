# Heliocentric Model

- Came around the 1500s thanks to [[Copernicus]]
  - He realized many of the observed motions in the sky could be explained by the [[Earth]] moving around the [[Sun]] while rotating
    - The motion of the [[Sun]]
    - The rotation of the [[celestial sphere]] (the [[Earth]] rotates, not the sphere)
- Explains retrograde motion by placing the [[Sun]] at the center
  - Planets move faster the closer they are to the [[Sun]]
- Less clumsy and has better symmetry than [[Ptolemy]]'s model ([[geocentric model]])
