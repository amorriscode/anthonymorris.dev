# Realism

- Can we prove [[idealism]] is false?
  - If not, then we can't know for sure that there's an external world

## Direct Realism

- Direct perceptual access to mind-independent objects
  - E.g. tables, chairs, and physical/material objects
- Objects exist independently of our perceiving them

## Indirect Realism

- Direct perceptual access to mind-dependent object
  - Sense data which stand between us and any physical/material objects
- What we directly perceive vs what actually exists
  - E.g. a stick that appears bent in water
