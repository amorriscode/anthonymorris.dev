# God

## Existence

### The Logical Problem

- Using [[evil]] to refute the claim that [[God]] exists
- [[Argument]] that the following to claims are logically incompatible
  - An O3 God exists
  - [[Evil]] exists
- If an O3 God existed, they would eliminate it
  - Omniscient --> knows when it will happen and can eliminate it
  - Omnipotent --> has the ability to eliminate it
  - Omnibenevolent --> wants to eliminate it
- Consensus --> not valid
  - God might have a reason for allowing some [[evil]]
  - Free will is more important than eliminating all [[evil]]
    - Free will means some beings might produce moral evil

### The Evidential Problem

- Perhaps God and [[evil]] can co-exist
- Then cannot be an O3 God and U3 [[evil]]
  - U3 --> unjustified, unnecessary, unmerited
    - [[Evil]] caused by free will can be ignored
- Evidence of U3 [[evil]] is evidence that O3 God doesn't exist
