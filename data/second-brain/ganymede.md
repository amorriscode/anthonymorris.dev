# Ganymede

- Largest of the Galilean [[moon]]s
- Made of ice
- Has a great deal of cratering
- $\frac{1}{4}$ of the surface seems old (heavily cratered) and the rest formed more recently
- Has differentiated like the [[terrestrial planet]]s
- Has a [[magnetic field]]
  - Signature of a partially molten interior
- [[Tidal force]]s from [[Jupiter]] have probably helped heat its interior and trigger major convulsions on its crust
