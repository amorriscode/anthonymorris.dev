# Assembly Language

- Low-level [[programming language]]
- Uses [[mnemonic]]s to represent each [[machine language]] instruction for a particular computer
  - Makes programmers more efficient
  - Better [[developer experience]]
- Uses an [[assembler]]
- Branch instructions allow the programmer to decide which instruction to execute next

## Assembler Directives

- Instructions to the [[assembler]] itself
  - Eg. `.END` --> signals end of the assembly language program
- Sometimes referred to as pseudo-operations
