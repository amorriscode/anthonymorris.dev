# Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

- Most complex of the layers
  - Often divided between MAC and LLC
    - MAC --> Media Access Control
    - LLC --> Logical Link Control
- One layer responsible for interfacing with physical hardware
  - Protocols used are programmed into firmware on hardware
- Checks for errors from the [[physical layer]]
- Puts control information in a header at the end of the packet
- Entire link layer is called a **frame**
- MAC address
  - Hardware address of source/destination NICs
  - Physical address, hardware address, or data link layer address
  - Embedded on every network adapter
  - Can only be used on a LAN
- Communicates between the [[network layer]] and the [[physical layer]]
