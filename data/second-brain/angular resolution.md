# Angular Resolution

- The ability of an image-forming device to distinguish small details of an object
  - Devices could be a [[telescope]], microscope, [[camera]], or an [[eye]]

## Formula

- $\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$
  - $\theta$ is the angular resolution
  - $\lambda$ is the [[wavelength]] of [[light]]
  - $D$ is the diameter of the lens' [[aperture]]
