# Baumol's cost disease

- Rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase in labour productivity
- Happens in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher productivity growth
	- Eg. violinists were paid more in 1965 than 1865 because if they weren't they'd stop being violinists and go take jobs where the salaries did increase
