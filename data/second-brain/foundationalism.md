# Foundationalism

- There must be a foundation of epistemically basic beliefs that support all our justified beliefs
- A belief is justified when it is inferred from basic beliefs
- _How do we tell which beliefs are basic?_

## Classical Foundationalism

- All justification ultimately rests on a foundation of basic beliefs which are indubitable or infallible

## Non-Classical (Weak) Foundationalism

- There are some basic beliefs that are minimally justified without reference to other beliefs
  - This justification could be potentially overturned by other beliefs
- Can stop an infinite regress of belief justification
