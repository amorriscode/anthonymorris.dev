# Subnet Mask

![Default IPv4 subnet masks](/assets/second-brain/2020-11-06-11-04-32.png)

- Used so devices can determine which part of an [[IP address]] is network ID and which part is host ID
  - Number of 1s in subnet mask --> number of bits in [[IP address]] belong to network ID
    - Example:
      - [[IP address]]: `192.168.123.132`
        - Binary: `11000000.10101000.01111011.1000010`
      - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
        - Binary: `11111111.111111111.111111111.00000000`
      - Network ID: `192.168.123.0`
      - Host ID: `0.0.0.132`

## Subnet Mask Tables

- Class A, Class B, and Class C networks can be subnetted
  - Each class --> different number of host info bits usable for subnet info
  - Varies depending on network class and the way subnetting is used

## Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)

- Allows subnets to be further subdivided
  - Smaller groupings until each subnet is about the same as the necessary [[IP address]] space
- Referred to as subnetting a subnet
