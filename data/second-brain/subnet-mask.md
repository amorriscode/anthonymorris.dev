# Subnet Mask

![Default IPv4 subnet masks](/assets/second-brain/2020-11-06-11-04-32.png)

- Used so devices can determine which part of an [[IP address]] is [[network ID]] and which part is [[host ID]]
  - Number of 1s in subnet mask --> number of bits belonging to the [[network ID]]
  - Number of 0s in subnet mask --> number of bits belonging to the [[host ID]]
    - Example:
      - [[IP address]]: `192.168.123.132`
        - Binary: `11000000.10101000.01111011.1000010`
      - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
        - Binary: `11111111.111111111.111111111.00000000`
      - [[Network ID]]: `192.168.123.0`
      - [[Host ID]]: `0.0.0.132`
- Useful for sending transmissions to another host
  - Compares bits in its own [[network ID]] to bits in the [[network ID]] of destination host
  - If bits match:
    - Destination host on same [[network]]
    - Sends transmission directly to destination host
  - If bits *don't* match:
    - Destination host on different [[network]]
    - Sends transmission directly to default gateway on the [[network]]

## Subnet Mask Tables

- Class A, Class B, and Class C [[network]]s can be subnetted ([[subnetting]])
  - Each class --> different number of host info bits usable for subnet info
  - Varies depending on [[network]] class and the way subnetting is used

## Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)

- Allows subnets to be further subdivided
  - Smaller groupings until each subnet is about the same as the necessary [[IP address]] space
- Referred to as subnetting a subnet
