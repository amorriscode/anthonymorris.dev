# ðŸ§  Anthony's Second Brain

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

Welcome to my second brain. For a while I was using [Roam](https://roamresearch.com), then I wanted my notes to be local so I moved to [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md). Then I discovered [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

Why'd I switch? I like using GitHub. I like using VS Code. Also my entire Obsidian directory (and all of my notes) got wiped out when I was setting up my home backup system.

It sounds worse that it was. Sort of.

Although you aren't necessarily supposed to organize your second brain, I'm using some sort of hacky version of [the PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/).
