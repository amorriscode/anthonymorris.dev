# Geometric Series

- The sum of all terms of a [[geometric sequence]]
- [[Series]] with a constant ratio between successive terms

## Formula

### Finite Geometric Series

- For $r \neq 1$
- $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{n - 1} = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k = a(\frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r})$
  - $a$ is the first term
  - $r$ is the common ratio
  - $n$ is the term you are looking for

## Infinite Geometric Series

- Absolute value for $r$ must be less than $1$ for the [[series]] to converge
  - If $r \gt 1$ then the sum is $\infty$
- $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + ar^{n - 1} = \displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k = \frac{a}{1 - r}$
