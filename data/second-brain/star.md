# Star
- Self-luminous, gaseous objects that fuse elements
- Obtain [[energy]] from nuclear [[fusion]]
- Considered a star when it can sustain itself through  [[nuclear reaction]]s (making its own [[energy]])
- How long it takes a star to form depends on its [[mass]]
- Twinkle due to the [[atmosphere]]
- The brightest [[star]]s are not the ones close to us
  - They are the ones emitting a large amount of [[energy]]
  - There are ~6000 [[star]]s visible to the unaided [[eye]]
- A star is said to be *true* if it becomes hot enough to fuse [[proton]]s to form [[helium]]

## Measuring the Characteristics of Stars
| Characteristic          | Technique                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface [[temperature]] | Determine the colour (very rough)                                                   |
|                         | Measure the spectrum and get the spectral type                                      |
| Chemical composition    | Determine which lines are present in the spectrum                                   |
| [[Luminosity]]          | Measure the apparent brightness and compensate for distance                         |
| [[Radial velocity]]     | Measure the [[doppler effect|doppler shift]] in the spectrum                                       |
| Rotation                | Measure the width of spectral lines                                                 |
| [[Mass]]                | Measure the period and [[radial velocity]] curves of spectroscopic [[binary star]]s |
| Diameter                | Measure the way a star's [[light]] is blocked by [[the Moon]]                       |
|                         | Measure the [[light]] curves and [[doppler effect|doppler shift]]s for eclipsing [[binary star]]s  |

## Measuring Distance from Earth
1. [[Parallax]]
   - Rely only on [[geometry]]
2. Using brightness measurements
   - Look at the star, determine it's color spectrum (good indication of it's actual brightness)
   - Compare the actual brightness with the apparent brightness, they can determine the distance
     - It's apparent brightness will be dimmer
3. Using an [[H-R diagram]]
   1. Observe distant star's apparent magnitude and spectral type
   2. Spectrum gives [[luminosity]] class
   3. Spectral class and [[luminosity]] class gives a brightness independent of distance
   4. Distance-magnitude relationship gives you distance

## Mass
- Knowing the [[mass]] of a star helps us estimate how long it will shine and what its ultimate fate will be
- The smallest [[mass]] that a true star can have is about $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the [[Sun]]
- Massive stars live for a short amount of time (die faster)
  - They are brighter
  - The brighter they are, the faster they burn
  - More mass --> hotter core and denser core
    - Makes [[fusion]] process happen faster

## Luminosity
- [[Luminosity]]
- How much light a star is emitting
- [[Photometry]] is used for measuring apparent magnitudes

## Types of Stars
- [[H-R diagram]] helps plot [[luminosity]] against [[temperature]] or spectral type
- [[Main sequence star]]s
  - Most populated
  - Generally hotter and more luminous
- [[Giant star]]s
  - More luminous
  - More red
- [[Supergiant star]]s
  - Even more luminous
- [[White dwarf]]s
  - Very faint but still hot
- [[Neutron Star]]s

## Colour and Temperature
| Star Colour | Approximate Temperature |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Blue        | 25,000 K                |
| White       | 10,000 K                |
| Yellow      | 6000 K                  |
| Orange      | 4000 K                  |
| Red         | 3000 K                  |
