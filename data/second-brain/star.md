# Star

- Obtain [[energy]] from nuclear [[fusion]]
- Considered a star when it can sustain itself through  nuclear reactions (making its own [[energy]])
- How long it takes a star to form depends on its [[mass]]

## Distance from the [[Earth]]

1. [[Parallax]]
   - Limited to ~400 [[light-year]]s
2. Using brightness measurements
   - Look at the star, determine it's color spectrum (good indication of it's actual brightness)
   - Compare the actual brightness with the apparent brightness, they can determine the Distance
     - It's apparent brightness will be dimmer
