# Star

- Self-luminous, gaseous objects that fuse elements
- Obtain [[energy]] from nuclear [[fusion]]
- Considered a star when it can sustain itself through  [[nuclear reaction]]s (making its own [[energy]])
- How long it takes a star to form depends on its [[mass]]
- Twinkle due to the [[atmosphere]]
- The brightest [[star]]s are not the ones close to us
  - They are the ones emitting a large amount of [[energy]]
  - There are ~6000 [[star]]s visible to the unaided [[eye]]
- A star is said to be *true* if it becomes hot enough to fuse [[proton]]s to form [[helium]]

## Measuring the Characteristics of Stars

| Characteristic          | Technique                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface [[temperature]] | 1. Determine the colour (very rough)                                                  |
|                         | 2. Measure the spectrum and get the spectral type                                     |
| Chemical composition    | Determine which lines are present in the spectrum                                     |
| [[Luminosity]]          | Measure the apparent brightness and compensate for distance                           |
| [[Radial velocity]]     | Measure the [[Doppler shift]] in the spectrum                                         |
| Rotation                | Measure the width of spectral lines                                                   |
| [[Mass]]                | Measure the period and [[radial velocity]] curves of spectroscopic [[binary star]]s   |
| Diameter                | 1. Measure the way a star's [[light]] is blocked by [[the Moon]]                      |
|                         | 2. Measure the [[light]] curves and [[Doppler shift]]s for eclipsing [[binary star]]s |

## Measuring Distance from [[Earth]]

1. [[Parallax]]
2. Using brightness measurements
   - Look at the star, determine it's color spectrum (good indication of it's actual brightness)
   - Compare the actual brightness with the apparent brightness, they can determine the distance
     - It's apparent brightness will be dimmer
3. Using an [[H-R diagram]]
   1. Observe distant star's apparent magnitude and spectral type
   2. Spectrum gives [[luminosity]] class
   3. Spectral class and [[luminosity]] class gives a brightness independent of distance
   4. Distance-magnitude relationship gives you distance

## Mass

- Knowing the [[mass]] of a star helps us estimate how long it will shine and what its ultimate fate will be
- The smallest [[mass]] that a true star can have is about $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the [[Sun]]

## Luminosity

- How much light a star is emitting
- [[Photometry]] is used for measuring magnitudes

## Types of Stars

- [[H-R diagram]] helps plot [[luminosity]] against [[temperature]] or spectral type
- Main sequence stars
  - Most populated
  - Generally hotter and more luminous
- [[Giant star]]s
  - More luminous
  - More red
- [[Super giant star]]s
  - Even more luminous
- [[White dwarf]]s
  - Very faint but still hot

### Spectral Classification

- Originally we used a system based on the strength of [[hydrogen]] absorption lines
  - Devised by [[Williamina Fleming]]
  - Strongest [[hydrogen]] lines were A --> O
  - [[Hydrogen]] lines alone are not that useful for classification
- A new system was introduced based on decreasing [[temperature]]
  - Introduced by [[Annie Jump Cannon]]
  - Each class is further subdivided into 10 subclasses
    - Using numbers 0 through 9
  - [[Mnemonic]] for remembering:
    - **O**h **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl, **K**iss **M**e
