# Star

- Self-luminous, gaseous objects that fuse elements
- Obtain [[energy]] from nuclear [[fusion]]
- Considered a star when it can sustain itself through  [[nuclear reaction]]s (making its own [[energy]])
- How long it takes a star to form depends on its [[mass]]
- Twinkle due to the [[atmosphere]]
- The brightest [[star]]s are not the ones close to us
  - They are the ones emitting a large amount of [[energy]]
  - There are ~6000 [[star]]s visible to the unaided [[eye]]
- A star is said to be *true* if it becomes hot enough to fuse [[proton]]s to form [[helium]]

## Measuring the Characteristics of Stars

| Characteristic          | Technique                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface [[temperature]] | 1. Determine the colour (very rough)                                                  |
|                         | 2. Measure the spectrum and get the spectral type                                     |
| Chemical composition    | Determine which lines are present in the spectrum                                     |
| [[Luminosity]]          | Measure the apparent brightness and compensate for distance                           |
| [[Radial velocity]]     | Measure the [[Doppler shift]] in the spectrum                                         |
| Rotation                | Measure the width of spectral lines                                                   |
| [[Mass]]                | Measure the period and [[radial velocity]] curves of spectroscopic [[binary star]]s   |
| Diameter                | 1. Measure the way a star's [[light]] is blocked by [[the Moon]]                      |
|                         | 2. Measure the [[light]] curves and [[Doppler shift]]s for eclipsing [[binary star]]s |

## Measuring Distance from [[Earth]]

1. [[Parallax]]
   - Limited to ~400 [[light-year]]s
2. Using brightness measurements
   - Look at the star, determine it's color spectrum (good indication of it's actual brightness)
   - Compare the actual brightness with the apparent brightness, they can determine the distance
     - It's apparent brightness will be dimmer

## Mass

- Knowing the [[mass]] of a star helps us estimate how long it will shine and what its ultimate fate will be
- The smallest [[mass]] that a true star can have is about $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the [[Sun]]
