# Spectroscopy

- Analyzing [[light]]
- Allows us to identify elements in the [[Universe]]
  - Composition of [[star]]s

## History

- [[Isaac Newton]] used prisms and lenses
  - Saw rainbows coming from sunlight
- Fraunhofer in [[1814]] magnified rainbows to look closer
  - Saw rainbows were not solid
- Bunsen burners in [[1857]]
  - Different chemicals into flame --> different colours
- [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] --> prism
  - Tied together the gaps and the different colours
  - Found colours were made up of emission lines
  - Number of lines and colours were unique to each element

## Kirchhoff's Laws of Spectroscopy

- Every element has a finger print
  - They interact with light in their own way
- Either in absorption or emission, finger print or spectral lines are in the same place
  - Have the same wavelengths

1. Solid, liquid, or dense gas will produce a continuous spectrum
2. Low-density gas will produce an emission spectrum
   - Looks all black, except for light being emitted
3. Light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, result will be an absorption spectrum
   - Full rainbow but stuff is being absorbed (certain [[wavelength]]s --> black)
