# Spectroscopy

- Analyzing [[light]]
- Allows us to identify [[element]]s in the [[Universe]]
  - Composition of [[star]]s
- [Interactive spectroscopy tool](http://www.jjdebenedictis.com/Spectroscopy/)

## History

- [[Isaac Newton]] used prisms and lenses
  - Saw [[rainbow]]s coming from sunlight
- Fraunhofer in [[1814]] magnified [[rainbow]]s to look closer
  - Saw [[rainbow]]s were not solid
- Bunsen burners in [[1857]]
  - Different [[chemical]]s into flame --> different colours
- [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] --> prism
  - Tied together the gaps and the different colours
  - Found colours were made up of emission lines
  - Number of lines and colours were unique to each [[element]]
