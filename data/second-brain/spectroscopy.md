# Spectroscopy

- Analyzing [[light]]
- Allows us to identify [[element]]s in the [[Universe]]
  - Composition of [[star]]s

## History

- [[Isaac Newton]] used prisms and lenses
  - Saw [[rainbow]]s coming from sunlight
- Fraunhofer in [[1814]] magnified [[rainbow]]s to look closer
  - Saw [[rainbow]]s were not solid
- Bunsen burners in [[1857]]
  - Different [[chemical]]s into flame --> different colours
- [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] --> prism
  - Tied together the gaps and the different colours
  - Found colours were made up of emission lines
  - Number of lines and colours were unique to each [[element]]

## Kirchhoff's Laws of Spectroscopy

- Every [[element]] has a finger print
  - They interact with [[light]] in their own way
- Either in absorption or emission, finger print or spectral lines are in the same place
  - Have the same [[wavelength]]s

1. Solid, liquid, or dense gas will produce a continuous spectrum
2. Low-density gas will produce an emission spectrum
   - Looks all black, except for light being emitted
3. Light composing a continuous spectrum passes through a cool, low-density gas, result will be an absorption spectrum
   - Full [[rainbow]] but stuff is being absorbed (certain [[wavelength]]s --> black)
