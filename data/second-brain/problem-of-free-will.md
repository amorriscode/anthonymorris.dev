# Problem of Free Will

- As follows
  - If [[determinism]] is true, then no one has [[free will]]
  - If [[indeterminism]] is true, then no one has [[free will]]
  - Therefore, no one has [[free will]]
- Generated by the following three claims:
  1. Principle of Causal Determinism
     - Every event $E$ that occurs is causally determined by prior conditions, such that, given those conditions $E$ had to occur
     - General to *every* event, including all human actions
  2. Principle of Alternative Possibilities
     - In order for an action to be freely chosen, one must have been able to do otherwise
  3. At least some actions are freely chosen
- Not all of the above claims can be true at the same time
  - Have to reject at least one
  - Which of the three claims are you most willing to give up?

### Possible Responses

#### Hard [[determinism]]

- Denial of [[free will]]
- Accepts PCD and PAP but rejects [[free will]]
  - [[Determinism]] is true and therefore we lack [[free will]]
  - [[Free will]] is just an illusion
- Either an action is causally determined or not
  - If an action is causally determined...
    - You could not have done otherwise
    - In order for it to have been freely chosen, you must've been able to do otherwise
    - You couldn't do otherwise so the action was not freely chosen
  - If an action is not causally determined...
    - Then it was random (not up to you)
    - For an action to be freely chosen, the decision to perform it must be up to you
    - You didn't choose the action
  - Whether an action is causally determined or not, no action is ever freely chosen
- Argues against [[agent causation]]
  - Introspection can't give you all the details of what lead you to your choice
  - We could still punish criminals even if their actions were causally determined
    - Punishment will causally determine less crime is committed

#### Soft [[determinism]] ([[compatibilism]])

- Redefine what [[free will]] is
  - Our will is determined by prior events in the causal chain but it also causes and determines actions
  - We can take moral responsibility for our actions
- Accepts PCD and [[free will]] but rejects PAP
  - [[Determinism]] is true but we still have [[free will]]
- All human actions could be causally determined but *some* could count as free actions
- There is a confusion at the root of [[free will]]
  - Problem of [[free will]] is a verbal dispute
- Free act vs unfree act
  - As defined by [[Walter Stace]]
    - A *free act* is one whose immediate causes are psychological states of the agent
    - An *unfree act* is one whose immediate causes are states of affairs *external* to the agent
  - As defined by [[David Hume]]
    - A person is free if and only if both of the following are met:
      - The person is acting in pursuit of what she desires and her actions are a result of her decisions
      - There are no obstacles in the person's way which prevent her from acting as she chooses
  - Refined definition
    - An agent acts freely if and only if both of the following are met:
      - The agent is moved to perform act $A$ by a desire to do $A$
      - The agent wants this desire to be the one that moves them to act

#### Libertarianism

- [[Free will]] is when a choice can be made that is *not* determined or necessitated by prior events
- Accept PAP and [[free will]] but rejects PCD
  - [[Free will]] exists but it's different than what the [[compatibilist]] says
  - *If* [[determinism]] is true, we lack [[free will]]
    - But we have [[free will]] and [[determinism]] is false
- Not related to the political term
- Free agents are capable of causing their own actions in a special way
  - [[Agent causation]]
- **The Descent Problem**
  - [[Indeterminism]] does *not* imply the existence of [[free will]]
    - Does uncaused randomness really help?
  - The determining factor of choosing an action is the agent
    - Agent --> uncaused cause of the action
- Argues against soft deterministic view with the hypnotism case
  - Hypnotism --> hypnotist can get you into a state to control your beliefs and desires
  - If the soft deterministic view allows for internal states to be influenced by external factors, then it seems invalid
- If human actions do not have causes and are chosen consciously, what are they based on?
  - They cannot be based on nothing
