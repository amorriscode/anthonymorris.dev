- The [[camera]] ([[Hasselblad]] [[500EL]]) that was used during [[the Moon]] had a sheet of glass called a Reseau plate
  - Put black reference crosses on the images that allowed measurements to be done with the photographs

[[astr-1101]]

- [[Telescope]]s
- Lenses or mirrors can make telescopes
  - Lens and mirror properties
    - Focus [[light]]
    - Reflect and refract [[light]]
- Keys to a good [[telescope]]
  - As much [[light]] as possible
  - As much detail as possible
- Focal length
  - Distance from lens/mirror --> focal point
- Focal point
  - Where all light rays converge
- Saving images allows [[astronomer]]s to analyze images with greater detail
  - Photographic plates --> chemicals that react to light
  - CCD (sensor)
    - Charge-coupled device
    - Light is stored as an electrical charge
- [[Human]] [[eye]]s are most sensitive to the [[colour]] [[green]]

[[phil-1101]]

- Argument against [[God]]
  - Video lectures
- [[God]]
  - Omnipotent --> all-powerful
    - We need to be careful with the definitions so we void illogical questions
      - Can [[God]] create a married bachelor?
      - Can [[God]] create a four-sided [[triangle]]?
      - A married bachelor is logically impossible
    - [[God]] cannot make contradictions (that which is logically impossible)
      - We assume [[God]] is bound by the laws of [[logic]]
    - [[God]] is bound by the laws of [[logic]] but not the laws of [[physics]]
  - Omniscient --> all-knowing
    - Everything that is true, [[God]] knows
  - Omnibenevolent --> all-loving
    - [[God]] wants to do as much [[good]] as possible
    - [[God]] wants to eliminate as much [[evil]] as possible
