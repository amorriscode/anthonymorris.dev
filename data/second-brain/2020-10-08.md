  - Lens and mirror properties
    - Focus [[light]]
    - Reflect and refract [[light]]
- Keys to a good [[telescope]]
  - As much [[light]] as possible
  - As much detail as possible
- Focal length
  - Distance from lens/mirror --> focal point
- Focal point
  - Where all light rays converge
- Saving images allows [[astronomer]]s to analyze images with greater detail
  - Photographic plates --> chemicals that react to light
  - CCD (sensor)
    - Charge-coupled device
    - Light is stored as an electrical charge
