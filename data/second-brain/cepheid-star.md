# Cepheid Star

- [[Variable star]]s
- Large, yellow, pulsating stars
- Rise rapidly to maximum [[light]] then falls more slowly to minimum [[light]]
- Several hundred known in our galaxy
- The period is directly related to [[luminosity]]
  - [[Period-luminosity relation]]
- Has a shell of partially ionized [[helium]]
  - Shell is effective at absorbing [[photons]] ([[energy]] from the core)
    1. The layer heats up and expands, making the [[star]] bigger and brighter
    2. Shell gets bigger and spread thin, stops absorbing [[photon]]s
    3. Shell starts contracting and shrinking
    4. Repeat steps

## Types

### Type 1

- Metal-rich
- Brighter

### Type 2

- Metal-poor
  - Mainly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Dimmer
