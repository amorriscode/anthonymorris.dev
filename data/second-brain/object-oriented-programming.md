# Object Oriented Programming

- Problem-solving methodology that produces a solution to a problem in terms of self-contained entities called _objects_
- **Object**
  - Entity that makes sense within context of a problem
- **Class**
  - Description of a group of objects with similar properties and behaviours
  - Any particular object is an _instance_ of a class
  - Contains
    - Fields
      - Named properties
    - Methods
      - Named algorithm defining one aspect of behaviour of a class
      - A function attached to a class
- **Encapsulation**
  - Language feature that enforces hiding information

## Design Methodology

- Brainstorming
  - Local possible classes
- Filtering
  - Find duplicate classes
  - Remove unnecessary classes
- Scenarios
  - Ensure we understand collaborations
  - Assign responsibilities of each class
    - _What_ the tasks are
    - Two types of responsibilities
      - Knowledge
        - What a class must know about itself
      - Behaviour
        - What a class must be able to do
- Responsibility algorithms
  - Design for all actions that classes must exhibit

## Inheritance

- Mechanism by which one class acquires the properties (data fields and methods) of another class
- **Superclass**
  - Class being inherited from
- **Derived class**
  - Class doing the inheriting
