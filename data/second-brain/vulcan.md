# Vulcan

- Vulcan was a theoretical [[planet]] proposed by [[Urbain Le Verrier]]
  - [[Urbain Le Verrier]] was studying the orbit of [[Mercury]] and discovered an anomaly that couldn't be explained by [[classical mechanics]]
  - So, Le Verrier came up with a new [[planet]] as an explanation for the observations
- The theory was later disproved
  - [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] ended up explaining the orbital observations
