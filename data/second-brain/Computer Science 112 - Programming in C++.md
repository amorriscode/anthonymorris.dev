# Computer Science 112 - Programming in C++

## Chapter 1 - Computer Programming Elements and Basics
- Programming requires two important skills:
	1. Ability to analyze and understand a problem
	2. Ability to describe that problem to a computer so it can solve the problem
- A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to solve a problem
- Steps to writing a program
	- Understand the problem
	- Design a solution
	- Draw a flow chart
	- Write pseudocode
	- Write code
	- Test and debug
	- Test with real users
	- Release the program
	- Iterate on the next version

### 5 basic elements of programming
1. Input
	- Getting data into the computer
2. Output
	- Getting results out of the computer
3. Looping and conditionals
	- Cycling through a set of instructions until a condition is met
4. Mathematical operations (arithmetic)
	- Performing calculations on your data
5. Variables and data structures
	- Storing data

### Types of loops
- Event-controlled loops
	- Can be stopped by an external event
- Counter-controlled loops
	- Stopped when a counter reaches a specific value

### Programming logic and syntax
- Syntax are the rules that dictate how to form a program
- Statements are a single line of code that does something
- A variable is a container used to store a value
- A keyword is a reserved word within a programming language
	- Eg. `print`, `var`, `let`, etc.

### Pseudocode
- A plain English version of the instructions the computer program should do
- Guidelines for writing useful pseudocode:
	- Break down logic for each individual step
	- Order is critical
	- Leaving some details out is okay

### Algorithms
- An algorithm is a recipe describing the steps a computer will take to solve a problem
