# Ideal Gas Law

- An approximation to help us model and predict the behaviour of gases
- Refers to hypothetical gas composed of molecules that follow a few rules:
  1. Ideal gas molecules do not attract or repel each other
  2. Ideal gas molecules themselves take up no volume

## Formula

$PV = nRT$

- $P$ --> pressure
- $V$ --> volume
- $T$ --> temperature
- $R$ --> gas constant
- $n$ --> number of moles of the gas
