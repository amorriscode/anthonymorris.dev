# Helioseismology

- Studies of solar oscillations
- The [[Sun]]'s surface is pulsating (expanding and contracting)
  - Similar to our [[lung]]s
- It takes a little over an hour for [[wave]]s to traverse the [[Sun]] from the centre to the surface
  - These [[wave]]s provide information about the solar interior
- Has shown that [[convection]] extends inward from the surface 30% of the way toward the [[Sun]]'s centre
