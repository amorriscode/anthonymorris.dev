# Accretion Disk

- Structure formed by diffuse material in orbital motion around a massive central body
  - Central body is typically a [[star]]
- [[Friction]] causes material in disk to spiral inward towards the central body
- [[Gravity]] and [[friction]] compress and raise the temperature of the material
  - Causes emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]]
