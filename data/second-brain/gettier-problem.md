# Gettier Problem

- Published by [[Edmund Gettier]]
- Challenges [[justified true belief]] with regards to [[knowledge]]
  - [[Justified true belief]] is *not* sufficient for [[knowledge]]

## Responses

- Perhaps we need to increase the bar for justification
  1. Require certainty or perfect evidence
     - This is incredibly hard to do
     - Rules out anything we don't know without *absolute certainty*
  2. No false steps allowed
  3. Add a fourth condition
     - That there does not exist any evidence that, if discovered, would give you a reason to overturn your belief
  4. Lower the bar for [[knowledge]]
     - Allow for epistemic luck
