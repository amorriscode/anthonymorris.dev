## [[cpsc-1045]]
- Lectures will be uploaded to YouTube
- Prof said [[JavaScript]] is _not_ a programming language, it's a _scripting_ language
  - This is not correct
  - It's _[[interpreted programming language]]_ instead of a _[[compiled programming language]]_
  - [Scripting languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) are certainly a type of programming language.

## [[phil-1101]]
- Completed a [[Philosophical Health Check]]
  - I had two tensions in my beliefs
    - According to the PDF that means I am "an admirably consistent thinker, if not entirely so"
  - This was a really fun exercise to complete and I'm extremely excited for this class
