# Wien's Law

- The brightest colour ([[wavelength]]) of [[radiation]] changes with [[temperature]]
- Hotter --> shorter peak [[wavelength]]
  - The [[wavelength]]s are inversely proportional to the [[temperature]]

## Formula

- $\lambda_{peak} = \frac{b}{t}$
  - $\lambda_{peak}$ is the peak [[wavelength]]
  - $T$ is the [[temperature]] of the object
  - $b$ is the Wien's displacement constant
