# Artificial Intelligence

- The study of [[computer]] systems that model and apply [[intelligence]] of the [[human]] [[mind]]
- Branches:
  - Knowledge representation
    - Techniques used to represent knowledge so [[computer]] systems can apply it to [[problem solving]]
  - Expert systems
    - [[Computer]] systems that embody knowledge of [[human]] experts
  - [[Artificial Neural Network]]s
    - [[Computer]] systems that mimic the processing of the [[human]] [[brain]]
  - [[Natural-language processing]]
    - Processing [[language]]s that [[human]]s use to communicate
  - [[Robotics]]

## Expert Systems

- Also know as a knowledge-based system
- Embodies and uses a specific set of information
- Extracts and process particular pieces from its set of information
- A rules-based system
  - Relies on a set of rules to infer what decision to make
