# Meditations on First Philosophy

- Originally published in [[1641]]
- Masked his true intention with notes about the existence of [[God]]
  - Primary goal: epistemological ([[epistemology]])
    - Discover their abilities in knowledge/belief
    - [[Epistemology]] --> "First [[Philosophy]]"
    - Before we can answer questions about "what is", we must answer questions about "what we can know"
  - Secondary goal: metaphysical ([[metaphysics]])
    - Use their discovered cognitive abilities
- Cartesian Skepticism
  - Skepticism --> question of knowledge claims
  - Form of philosophical skepticism
  - Questions the very foundation of knowledge
- Deals with the existence of [[God]] and the distinction between the human soul and body

## Meditation I

- Goal is to show us that the senses do not provide _certainty_
  - Belief in them needs to be _argued for_
- Stages of Doubt
  1. Doubts arising from the senses
     - [[Deductive argument]]
     - The argument
       - Premise 1: Our senses have deceived us in the past
       - Premise 2: It is unwise to trust completely those who have deceived us even once
       - Conclusion: One should not place absolute confidence in one's senses
     - Premise 2 could be rejected in that it only applies to specific cases
       - Observing things far away, tiny things, things in bad light, etc.
  2. The dream hypothesis
     - The argument
       - Premise 1: You can never be completely certain that you are not dreaming
       - Premise 2: You can only be completely certain that your perceptions are accurate if you can be sure you aren't dreaming
       - Conclusion: You can never be completely sure your perceptions are accurate
  3. Imperfect [[God]] hypothesis
     - An all-powerful [[God]] could manipulate math, etc.
  4. Evil demon hypothesis
     - All-powerful, evil demon doing everything possible to deceive you

## Meditation II

- The [[argument]]
  - I think, *therefore* I exist
    - I think, therefore I am
    - First person proposition
    - Psychological component
  - If I'm thinking, there must be a "me" to do the thinking
  - What is the I that thinks?
    - Something aware of its own consciousness
