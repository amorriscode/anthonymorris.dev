[[Space]] [[Orbit]]

# Orbital Eccentricity
- Amount by which the path of an orbiting object deviates from a perfect circle
	- `e = 0` --> perfectly circular [[orbit]]
	- `e = 1` --> highly elliptical [[orbit]]
- [[Orbit]]s of [[planet]]s in [[the Solar System]] have a maximum `e ~= 0.2`
	- They are very nearly circular
