- Theoretical object that reflects zero [[light]] and emits [[light]] because its temperature
- As it gets hotter, the object will radiate electromagnetic waves until absorption and radiation are in balance

## Stefan-Boltzmann Law

- As an object heats up, it emits more [[electromagnetic radiation]] at all [[wavelength]]s
- Rate of emitted energy goes as the fourth power of its temperature
  - Small rise in temperature --> huge increase in energy emitted

## Wein's Law

- The brightest colour ([[wavelength]]) of radiation changes with temperature
- Hotter --> shorter peak wavelength
