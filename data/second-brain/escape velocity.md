# Escape Velocity

- [[Velocity]] needed to escape from gravitational pull of an object
- Escaping an [[orbit]] of an object

## Formula

- $v_{escape} = \sqrt{\frac{2Gm}{r}}$
  - $G$ is the universal gravitational constant (see [[gravity]])
  - $m$ is the mass of the object
  - $r$ is the distance to the object
