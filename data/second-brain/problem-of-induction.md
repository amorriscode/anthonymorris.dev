# Problem of Induction

- Philosophical question whether inductive reasoning ([[inductive argument]]) leads to [[knowledge]]
  - Inductive [[logic]] can only provide a conclusion that *probably* true
- Most famous proposition by [[David Hume]]
- Are we justified in accepting the [[principle of uniformity of nature]]?
  - There is no reason it is *impossible* for this principle to break down
- Using induction to prove the [[principle of uniformity of nature]] is circular
  - Therefore not justified
- Questions posed by [[David Hume]]
  - Are our ordinary standards of reasonableness themselves reasonable?
  - Are our ordinary standards for induction reasonable?
    - Are [[inductive argument]]s reliable?
- We lack justification for
  - Generalizations about properties of objects based on observations
    - E.g. all swans we have seen are white so all swans are white
  - Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it has in the past
    - E.g. The [[Sun]] will rise tomorrow
    - [[Principle of uniformity of nature]] ([[uniformitarianism]])
