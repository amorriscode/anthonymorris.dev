# Problem of Induction

- Proposed by [[David Hume]]
- Are we justified in accepting the [[principle of uniformity of nature]]?
  - There is no reason it is _impossible_ for this principle to break down
- Using induction to prove the [[principle of uniformity of nature]] is circular
  - Therefore not justified
- Questions posed by [[David Hume]]
  - Are our ordinary standards of reasonableness themselves reasonable?
  - Are our ordinary standards for induction reasonable?
    - Are [[inductive argument]]s reliable?
