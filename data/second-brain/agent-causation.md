# Agent Causation

- Argument from introspection
  - Options in your decisions feel up to you
    - Not determined by prior conditions
    - Not random
- Argument from moral responsibility
  - Agent causation has to be true otherwise we can't hold people morally responsible for their actions

## Objections

- The Problem of Difficult Decisions
  - Reasons for choosing between two options are equal
  - Getting stuck in a space of indecision
  - Eventually you make a decision... but why?
    - The options were equal
    - How'd you pick one over the other?
