- Good [[design]] - [[Dieter Rams]]' ideology
  - Source: [Good design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design)
  - Makes me think of [[sound design]] in [[film]]
    - Has a huge impact but the viewer shouldn't really notice it unless looking for it
    - It is sound _design_ after all ;)
  - Ten principles:
    - **Good design is innovative**
      - Always new opportunities for innovative design
      - Innovative design develops in tandem with innovative technology
    - **Good design makes a product useful**
      - Products are bought to be used
      - Functional, psychological, aesthetic
    - **Good design is aesthetic**
      - Integral to usefulness because products we use everyday influence our well-being
    - **Good design makes a product understandable**
      - At best, self-explanatory
    - **Good design is unobtrusive**
      - Like tools --> neither decorative objects nor works of art
      - Design should be restrained
        - Leave room for user's self-expression
    - **Good design is honest**
      - Doesn't manipulate the consumer
      - No empty promises
    - **Good design is long-lasting**
      - Not fashionable
      - Never appears antiquated
      - Tough in today's throwaway society
    - **Good design is thorough down to the last detail**
      - Nothing is arbitrary or left to chance
      - Care and accuracy --> respect to the user
    - **Good design is environmentally-friendly**
      - Important contributions to preserve the environment
      - Conserves resources
      - Minimizes physical and visual pollution
        - Throughout the entire lifecycle
    - **Good design is as little design as possible**
      - Less, but better
      - Concentrates on the essentials
        - [[Essentialism]]
      - Back to purity, back to simplicity
