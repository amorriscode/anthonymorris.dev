# Doppler Effect

- A stationary source produces [[wave]]s with a specific [[wavelength]]
  - Could be [[sound]] [[wave]]s, [[light]] [[wave]]s, etc.
  - An observer some distance away expects to "see" the [[wave]]s with the same [[wavelength]]
- If the source moves towards/away from the observer, the observer will see the Doppler effect
  - Shift in observed [[wavelength]]
