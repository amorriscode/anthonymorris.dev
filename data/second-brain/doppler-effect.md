# Doppler Effect

![Example of redshift and blueshift](/assets/second-brain/2021-02-05-09-12-54.png)

- Change in [[frequency]] of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source
  - A stationary source produces [[wave]]s with a specific [[wavelength]]
    - Could be [[sound]] [[wave]]s, [[light]] [[wave]]s, etc.
    - An observer some distance away expects to "see" the [[wave]]s with the same [[wavelength]]
  - If the source moves towards/away from the observer, the observer will see the Doppler effect
    - Shift in observed [[wavelength]]
- Each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer/further from the observer than the crest of the previous wave
  - Each wave takes slightly less/more time to reach the observer than the previous one

## Redshift

- Increase in [[wavelength]]
- Decrease in [[frequency]] and [[photon]] [[energy]]
- Occurs when two objects are moving apart

## Blueshift

- Decrease in [[wavelength]]
- Increase in [[frequency]] and [[photon]] [[energy]]
- Occurs when two objects are moving closer to each other
