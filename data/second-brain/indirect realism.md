# Indirect Realism

- Proposed by [[John Locke]]
- We cannot perceive material objects, we can only perceive mental pictures of them
- Direct perceptual access to mind-dependent object
  - Sense data which stand between us and any physical/material objects
- What we directly perceive vs what actually exists
  - E.g. a stick that appears bent in water
  - [Argument from illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_illusion)
