# Proton-Proton Chain

- Why the [[Sun]] is shining
- One of two known sets for nuclear [[fusion]] by which [[star]]s convert [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]]
- Only possible at temperatures and densities found at the centres of [[star]]s
  - Even there, cannot overcome charge repulsion
- First step in the chain is very difficult
  - Generally takes a long time

## Steps

1. ${}^1H + {}^1H \rarr {}^2H + e^+ + v_e$
   - Two protons fuse
   - Make deuterium, one positron, and one neutrino
2. ${}^1H + {}^2H \rarr {}^3He + Î³$
   - Deuterium nucleus fuses with a protein
   - Makes helium-3, gamma ray
3. ${}^3He + {}^3He \rarr {}^4He + {}^1H + {}^1 H$
   - Step 1 & 2 must happen twice
   - Two helium-3 nuclei fuse to form helium-4
   - Two excess protons are released
