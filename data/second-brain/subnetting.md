# Subnetting

- Solves fundamental problem with classful addressing:
  - Too many host addressed assigned to each classful [[network]]
  - [[IP address]]es get used up too quickly
  - E.g. Class B [[network]] can have 65,534 [[IP address]]es
    - Difficult to manage such a highly populated [[LAN]]
    - Results in poor performance
- Benefits
  - [[Network]] documentation is easier to manage
  - Problems are easier to locate and resolve
  - [[Router]]s can more easily manage [[IP address]] spaces that don't overlap
  - Routing is more efficient when [[IP address]] spaces are mathematically related at a binary level
- Useful resources:
