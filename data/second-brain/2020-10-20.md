[[astr-1101]]

- Parker Solar Probe presentation
  - Studying the [[Sun]]
    - Analyze the Corona and Solar winds
    - Why is the Corona hotter than the surface of the [[Sun]]?
    - Why are solar winds accelerating in the Corona?
  - Originally thought a probe could only reach the [[Sun]] with gravitational assist from [[Jupiter]]
  - Named after [[Eugene Parker]]
    - Shaped field of heliophysics
    - Theorized existence of solar winds
  - Designed and built at [[Johns Hopkins University]]
    - ~1.5 billion
  - Testing
    - Went through acoustic testing
      - 150 decibels
      - Tests to make sure launch sound won't damage the probe
    - Launched on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] [[rocket]]
    - Heat shield in thermal vacuum
      - Fluctuation of temperatures
      - 2500˚F --> -320˚F
      - Imitating airless vacuum of space
    - Purple gaze test
      - Lasers shot at the probe
      - Testing solar panels
        - Will stay electrically charged throughout the mission
    - Space environment testing
      - Simulation of the environment the probe will go through
      - Cools to -320˚F
      - Lasts seven weeks
    - Faraday cup testing
      - Used IMAX projectors
      - Simulated the [[Sun]]
      - Could heat up to 1800˚F
  - 400 thermocouples installed for monitoring
  - 6.2 million km away from the [[Sun]]
    - Closest any spacecraft has ever been
  - Magnetic switchbacks
  - Rotation of the solar wind
  - Dust free zone
    - 11.3 million km --> dust start decreasing
  - Recorded sounds of dust hitting the probe
  - Turbulence of solar wind
    - Is it a constant force?
- Aurorae presentation
  - How auroras function
    - High energy particles from [[Sun]] --> collide with neutral particles in atmospheres
    - [[Sun]]'s Corona --> outer space via solar wind --> [[Earth]]'s magnetosphere
      - Corona --> outermost layer, hottest region
      - Magnetosphere --> region of space surrounding [[Earth]] where magnetic sphere is dominant
    - Coronal mass ejection
      - Release of plasma
      - Overpowers [[Earth]]'s magnetosphere
  - Auroras on other [[planet]]s
    - Jupiter
      - Only visible in infrared
      - Continuous
    - Saturn
      - Visible in ultraviolet
    - Mars
      - Visible in ultraviolet
  - Mythology
    - Aurora (Roman)
    - Eos (Greek)
