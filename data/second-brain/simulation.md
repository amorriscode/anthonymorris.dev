# Simulation

- Used to study complex systems
- The development of a **model** of a **complex system** and the experimental manipulation to observe results
  - **System**
    - Groups of objects interacting in some way
    - Dynamic, interactive, and complicated
  - **Model**
    - An abstraction of a real system
    - Representation of the objects within a system and the rules that govern those objects
- Can be a **continuous** or **discrete-event** simulation
  - **Continuous**
    - Time is continuous
    - Changes are expressed in terms of a set of differential equations reflecting the relationships among the set of characteristics
      - Characteristics are chosen to model the system must be understood with mathematics
    - Frequently used by engineers and economists
  - **Discrete-event**
    - Made up of entities, attributes, and events
      - Entity
        - Some object in the real system
      - Event
        - Interaction between entities
