# Deductive Argument

- _Intends_ to provide conclusive support for its conclusion
  - When providing conclusive support for its conclusion, it is **valid**
  - When _not_ providing conclusive support for its conclusion, it is **invalid**
  - Validity is _all or nothing_
- If _premises_ provided are true, the _conclusion_ must be true
  - Are premises true?
  - Do the premises lead to this conclusion?
- True premises aren't enough (must be valid)
  - Gasoline is poison (true)
  - Bleach is poison (true)
  - **Conclusion:** gasoline is bleach (false)
- Deductively valid arguments with true premises are **sound**
  - Valid arguments are not necessarily true (sound)!

## Example

- Unjustly killing innocent people is wrong
- THe holocaust was a case of unjustly killing innocent people
- **Conclusion:** Holocaust was wrong
