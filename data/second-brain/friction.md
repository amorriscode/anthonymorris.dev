# Friction

## Kinetic Friction

- Sliding Friction
- [[Force]] of kinetic friction
- Acts in the opposite direction of a sliding object's [[velocity]]
  - Is proportional to the normal [[force]] between the two surfaces
    - Not a fundamental law but an experimental relation

### Kinetic Friction Equation

- $F_{fr} = \mu_kF_N$
  - $F_{fr}$ is the friction [[force]]
  - $F_N$ is the normal [[force]]
  - $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction
    - Depends on the nature of the two surfaces
    - Has no units

## Static Friction

- A [[force]] parallel to two surfaces
- Can arise when they are not sliding

### Static Friction Equation

- $(F_{fr})_{max} = \mu_sF_N$
  - $F_{fr}$ is the friction [[force]]
  - $F_N$ is the normal [[force]]
  - $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction
- $F_{fr} \leq \mu_sF_N$
