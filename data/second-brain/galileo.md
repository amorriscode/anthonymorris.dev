# Galileo

## Astronomical Discoveries

- Proved [[the Moon]] wasn't a perfect sphere (saw mountains/craters)
- Built a [[telescope]] to help with observations
- Discovered there could be centers of motion that are also in motion
  - Proof that [[the Moon]] could keep up with it even if it was in motion
  - Found four moons revolving around Jupiter
  - Saw [[Venus]] go through phases just like [[the Moon]] so it must revolve around the [[Sun]] too
    - [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Venus]] phases didn't align with [[Galileo]]'s
