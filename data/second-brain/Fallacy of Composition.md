[[fallacy]]

# Fallacy of Composition
- When someone assumes something is true of a whole based on a fact about some part of the whole
	- Eg. a vehicle is made of rubber because the tire is made of rubber
- Taking attributes of part of an object and applying them to the entire object
- Opposite of the [[law of identity]]
