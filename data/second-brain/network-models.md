# Network Models

- Topology
  - How parts of a whole work together
- Physical topology
  - Mostly related to hardware
  - How devices connect to form the physical network
- Logical topology
  - How software connects to the network
  - How users/programs gain access to the network
- Network operating system (NOS)
  - Controls access to the entire network
  - Required by client-server models

## Peer-to-Peer Network Model

- OS of each [[computer]] on the network is responsible for controlling access to its resources
  - No centralized control
- [[Computer]]s form logical groups and users
  - Nodes or hosts
  - May share resources (and control access to them)

### Advantages

- Simple configuration
- Less expensive

### Disadvantages

- Not scalable
- Not secure by default
- Not practical on a large scale

## Client-Server Network Model

- Resources managed by NOS via centralized database
  - In Windows it's Active Directory
- Client
  - A [[computer]] making a request to another
  - Resources aren't shared directly between clients
- Shared resources are on a server
  - Access controlled by domain database
- NOS is responsible for:
  - Managing client data and resources
  - User, file, and network access

### Advantages compared to peer-to-peer networks

- Credentials assigned in one place
- Shared resources are centrally controlled
- Central place for debugging, diagnostics, and correction
- More scalable
