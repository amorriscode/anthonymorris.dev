# Asteroid

- Rocky metallic bodies orbiting the [[Sun]]
- Exist mostly between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]
  - The [[asteroid belt]]
- Most are remnants of the initial population of [[the Solar System]] that existed before [[planet]]s formed
- Contain very little easily evaporated material
- Counts
  - ~200 larger than 100 km
  - ~1000 larger than 30 km

## Types

### C-Type (Carbonaceous) Asteroids

- Dark with low reflectivity (3-4%)
  - Like a lump of [[coal]]
- Composed of silicates mixed with dark, organic [[carbon]] compounds
- Original solar nebula material
- Never differentiated

### S-Type (Stony or Siliceous) Asteroids

- Reflectivity of ~15%
- Stony or silicate composition
- Differentiated

### M-Type (Metallic) Asteroids

- Less numerous than S or C types
- Composed primarily of metal
- Differentiated
