# Big O

- How fast an algorithm is
  - Rate of growth of operations
  - How the running time will increase as the input increases
- Worst-case run time
- _Can we do better?_

## Common Run Times

- Fastest --> slowest

| Big O              | Name             |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| $O(log \; n)$      | log time         |
| $O(n)$             | linear time      |
| $O(n \; log \; n)$ |                  |
| $O(n^2)$           | exponential time |
| $O(n!)$            | factorial time   |
