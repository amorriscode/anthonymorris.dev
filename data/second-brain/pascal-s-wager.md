# Pascal's Wager

- [[Pragmatic argument]]
  - Shows it is rational to believe in [[God]] despite a lack of evidence
    - Our _best bet_
  - Deductive
- [[Blaise Pascal]]'s definition of [[God]]
  - Assumed a Christian [[God]]
  - Being who is:
    - Infinite in nature
    - Promises an infinite reward to all who believe
- Believing in [[God]] has a much higher "value" than not believing
  - (A) Believing and [[God]] exists --> infinite gain
  - (A) Believing and [[God]] does not exist --> finite loss
  - (B) Not believing and [[God]] exists --> eternal damnation
  - (B) Not believing and [[God]] does not exist --> finite gain
- Expected utility
  - A --> $(+\infty)(0.5) - (finite)(0.50) = +\infty$
  - B --> $(-\infty)(0.5) - (finite)(0.50) = -\infty$
- Expected utility of believing is _infinitely_ better than not believing
- Possibility of [[God]] existing can be as small as you want but _cannot_ be 0
- How/why you choose to believe doesn't matter, [[God]] doesn't care

## The Argument

1. Cannot demonstrate the truth of [[God]]'s existence
2. We must either believe or not
3. If we have to choose between two options, and can't demonstrate which is correct, we should choose the option with the biggest payoff
4. Expected payoff of believing in [[God]] outweighs the expected payoff of not believing
5. Best option --> believe in [[God]]

## Objections

- No practical importance
  - Someone who doesn't believe can't just become a believer

## Many-gods Objection

- Did assuming a Christian [[God]] discount other conceptions of [[God]]?
- Anyone believing in a different religion --> counted as a non-believer from perspective of [[Christianity]]
- Have to take into account _which_ [[god]] one believes in
  - Payoffs become unclear

## Evidentialist Objection

- [[Evidentialism]]
- The idea that it is wrong to believe something without sufficient evidence
- The main argument seems to set this objection aside

## [[William James]] on Pascal's Wager

- Tried to improve Pascal's Wager
- Defended religious faith in The Will to Believe
- Framework
  - **Hypothesis**
    - Something you might believe
    - A candidate for belief
    - **Live** --> something you could believe as the result of an inquiry
  - **Option**
    - Two more more competing hypotheses
    - Can be:
      - **Live**
        - Both hypotheses are live
      - **Forced**
        - If you have two chose one or the other of its hypotheses
      - **Momentous**
        - Great significance on the choice
        - The opportunity of the choice is fleeting
      - All options with the above features is **genuine**
- Anti-evidentialism
  - When an option is **genuine**
    - Cannot settle with intellectual ability alone
    - One must decide using non-rational grounds
    - Four **genuine** cases
      - Moral
      - Personal relations (marriage, etc)
      - Social cooperation
      - Religious
- Believes scientific options are _not_ momentous
- On religious belief
  - Best things are eternal
  - Better off now if we believe this is true

### [[William James]]' Argument

- Does not claim agnosticism or atheism is _irrational_
  - Simply concluding religious belief is _rational_
    - Defending the rationality of religious belief
- Religious belief is a _genuine_ option
  - Live, forced, and momentous
- Whenever presented with a genuine option, two alternative intellectual strategies are available
  - Agnosticism
    - Risk losing out on possible truth (eternal happiness) in order to minimize risk of error
  - Belief
    - Risk error for a chance at a possible truth (eternal happiness)
