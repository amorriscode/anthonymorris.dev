# CIDR (Classless Interdomain Routing)

- Provides additional ways of arranging network and host info in an [[IP address]]
- Takes network ID and host's [[IP address]] and follows it with a forward slash followed by the number of bits used for a network ID
  - E.g. `192.168.89.127/24`
    - 24 represents the number of 1s in the [[subnet mask]]
      - Number of bits in the network ID
    - Known as a CIDR block
