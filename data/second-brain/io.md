- Most volcanically active body in [[the Solar System]]
  - Discovered during the [[Voyager mission]]
  - Shield [[volcano]]es
  - Sulfuric compounds
  - Consists of hot silicate lava like the [[volcano]]es on [[Earth]]
- Eruptive plumes are created when hot lava encounters frozen deposits of [[sulfur]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]
  - The plumes cool and then fall back to the surface in "snowfalls"
- Craterless because of the amount of volcanic activity
- [[Tidal heating]]
- Low [[gravity]]
- Thin [[atmosphere]]
