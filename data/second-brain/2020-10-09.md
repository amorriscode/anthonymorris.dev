- Interview with [[Daniel Ek]] from [[Spotify]]
  - [The Observer Effect – Daniel Ek](https://www.theobservereffect.org/daniel.html)
  - Good meetings
    - Three key elements
      - Desired outcome --> clear ahead of time
      - Various options are clear (ideally ahead of time)
      - Role of each participant is clear
    - You don't need _fewer_ meetings, you need _better_ meetings
  - How do you create the flow of ideas in companies?
    - This tends to slow down when a company gets bigger
      - Less interaction between folks
  - “What is the essence of the idea that this single topic is trying to get at?”
