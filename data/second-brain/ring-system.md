# Ring System

- Billions of small particles orbiting close to their [[planet]] in a ring formation
- All [[Jovian planet]]s have ring systems

## Formation Theories

- Breakup hypothesis
  - Rings are remains of a shattered [[moon]]
  - A passing [[comet]] or [[asteroid]] might have collided with the [[moon]] smashing it into pieces
  - [[Tidal force]]s then pulled fragments apart and they created a disk
- Lacking [[moon]] hypothesis
  - Particles were unable to form a [[moon]]
