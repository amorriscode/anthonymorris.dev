# Kepler Space Telescope

- Looking for [[Earth]]-like [[exoplanet]]s
- Named after [[Johannes Kepler]]
- Launched March 7, [[2009]]
  - At the time of launch it was the largest [[camera]] system launched into [[space]]
- Part of [[NASA]]'s [[Discovery Program]]
  - Small missions with a low budget
- Decommissioned in October 30, [[2018]]
- Trailing behind [[Earth]]
  - [[Earth]]-trailing [[orbit]]
- Observes [[planet]]s using the [[transit method]]
  - After it observes a [[planet]], observations are confirmed using ground [[telescope]]s and [[math]] models

## Objectives

- How many [[Earth]] size (or larger) [[planet]]s are there?
- Shape of the [[orbit]]s of such [[planet]]s

## Instruments

- [[Camera]]
  - Made out of 42 [[CCD]]s
