# Electromagnetism

- Intimate relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]
- Theory of electromagnetism developed by [[James Clark Maxwell]]
  - Deals with particles electric charges and their effects, especially when they are moving
- Electric and [[magnetic field]] changes --> trigger each other
  - Changing [[magnetic field]]s can produce electric currents
    - Changing electric fields
  - Changing electric fields can produce changing [[magnetic field]]s

## Electromagnetic Waves

- Can move through a vacuum
  - The _aether_ was made up in the nineteenth century because scientists couldn't grasp the fact that these waves can move in a vacuum
- All electromagnetic waves move at the same speed in empty space
  - The speed of [[light]]
  - Fastest possible speed in the [[Universe]]
  - Since they move at the same speed, [[wavelength]] and [[frequency]] are related
