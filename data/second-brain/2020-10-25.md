- Guiding questions for [[Rene Descartes]] meditations
  - At the beginning of Meditation I, [[Rene Descartes]]â€™ meditator says that they are going to rid themselves of all the opinions which they had formerly accepted."
    - Why on earth would anybody want to do that?
    - What strategy does the meditator say they are going to use, in performing this task?
    - To rid themself of all these opinions, do they think they need to show they are false or something weaker than that?
    - Do they think they need to take up each belief individually or is there a way to process hoards of them at a time?
      - [[Rene Descartes]] foundationalism --> view that knowledge has a building-like structure
      - No, destroy the foundations and all that is built upon it will crumble down
  - The first doubt the meditator brings forward concerns the testimony of their senses
    - What are the premises of the [[argument]]?
    - What is its conclusion?
    - If the premises were true, would the conclusion have to be true too?
  - The second doubt the meditator brings forward begins with the fact that they sometimes dream
    - What beliefs do they think are called into doubt by this [[argument]]?
    - Which beliefs do they suggest are left untouched by the dream argument?
    - Why do they conjecture that the dream argument leaves them unscathed?
    - What names do they give to the things these beliefs are about?
    - Which disciplines investigate these things?
  - The third doubt the meditator brings forward begins with their belief in [[God]]
    - What additional beliefs does [[Rene Descartes]] mean to call into doubt by this argument and how?
    - What objection does he consider and how does he reply to it?
  - The fourth doubt the meditator brings forward starts with the possibility that [[God]] does not exist
    - What further beliefs does the meditator mean to call into doubt by this argument and how?
  - What is the purpose of the last paragraph of Meditation I when the meditator says they shall suppose [[God]] is some evil genius?
  - At the beginning of Meditation II, the meditator attempts to establish some belief to be certain and indubitable (beyond any possible doubt)
    - What key conclusions does the meditator think they can be certain of?
    - Do you agree?
    - Are you able to establish these same conclusions with absolute certainty?
  - What is the point of the meditator's wax example?
    - All properties observed with the senses can change
      - Some of the properties can't be discovered through the senses
    - How might this example relate to [[Rene Descartes]]' rejection of Aristotelean [[empiricism]]?
