- Period of time in the early solar system
  - First few hundred million years
  - ~4.1 - 3.8 billion years ago
- Disproportionately large numbers of [[asteroid]]s were colliding with early terrestrial [[planet]]
- Evidence derives from lunar samples brought back by the [[Apollo missions]]
  - Showed most impacts happened in a narrow interval of time
- Tons of things colliding
- Mixing of elements
- Possible formation of [[the Moon]]
- Most of [[Earth]]'s water probably accumulated during this time
