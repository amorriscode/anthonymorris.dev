- Chapter 24.1: Introducing [[General Relativity]]
  - Learning Objectives
    - Discuss some of the key ideas of the theory of [[general relativity]]
    - Recognize that one's experiences of [[gravity]] and [[acceleration]] are interchangeable and indistinguishable
    - Distinguish between Newtonian ideas of [[gravity]] and Einsteinian ideas of [[gravity]]
    - Recognize why the theory of [[general relativity]] is necessary for understanding the nature of [[black hole]]s
- Chapter 24.2: [[Spacetime]] and [[Gravity]]
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe [[Albert Einstein]]'s view of [[gravity]] as the warping of [[spacetime]] in the presence of massive objects
    - Understand [[isaac newton]]'s concept of gravitational force between two massive objects and [[Albert Einstein]]'s concept of warped [[spacetime]] are different explanations for the same observed accelerations of one massive object in the presence of another massive object
- Chapter 24.3: Tests of [[General Relativity]]
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe unusual motion of [[Mercury]] around the [[Sun]] and explain how [[general relativity]] explains the observed behaviour
    - Provide examples of evidence for [[light]] rays being bent by massive objects, as predicted by [[general relativity]]'s theory about the warping of [[spacetime]]
- Chapter 24.4: [[Time]] in [[General Relativity]]
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe how Einsteinian [[gravity]] slows clocks and can decrease a [[light]] [[wave]]'s [[frequency]] of oscillation
    - Recognize that the gravitational decrease in a [[light]] [[wave]]'s [[frequency]] is compensated by an increase in the [[light]] [[wave]]'s [[wavelength]] - the so-called [[gravitational redshift]] - so that the [[light]] continues to travel at constant [[speed]]
- Chapter 24.5: [[Black Hole]]s
  - Learning Objectives
    - Explain the [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[black hole]]
    - Discuss why the popular notion of [[black hole]]s as great sucking monsters that can ingest material at great distances from them is erroneous
    - Use the concept of warped [[spacetime]] near a [[black hole]] to track what happens to any object that might fall into a [[black hole]]
    - Recognize why the concept of a singularity - which is infinite [[density]] and zero volume - presents major challenges to our understanding of [[matter]]
- Chapter 24.6: Evidence for [[Black Hole]]s
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe what to look for when seeking and confirming the presence of a stellar [[black hole]]
    - Explain how a [[black hole]] is inherently black yet can be associated with luminous matter
    - Differentiate between stellar [[black hole]]s and the [[black hole]]s in the centers of galaxies
- Chapter 24.7: Gravitational Wave [[Astronomy]]
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe what a [[gravitational wave]] is, what can produce it, and how fast it propagates
    - Understand the basic mechanisms used to detect [[gravitational wave]]s
