- Analyses of [[knowledge]]
- Guiding questions
  - According to our textbook authors, what are the three necessary conditions for [[knowledge]]?
    - Why is justification required for [[knowledge]]?
    - Why isn't true belief enough for [[knowledge]]?
  - What is the difference between [[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]]?
    - Which seems more plausible and why?
  - What is the difference between [[internalism]] and [[externalism]]?
  - What is [[reliabilism]] and why does it count as an externalist theory?
  - Why does [[Edmund Gettier]] think the [[justified true belief]] account of [[knowledge]] is incorrect?
    - How are his examples supposed to provide counterexamples to this account?
  - Do you think [[Edmund Gettier]] is right?
    - Why or why not?
- Necessary and sufficient conditions
  - **Necessary condition** ([[Necessity]])
    - Condition for something, *F*, is a condition that must be met in order for *F* to be present
  - **Sufficient condition** ([[Sufficiency]])
    - Condition for something, *F*, is a condition that, if met, *guarantees* that *F* is present
  - Complete set of necessary conditions together constitute a sufficient condition for *F*
  - Entire set --> **individually necessary and jointly sufficient**
    - INJS
    - Often used to analyze important philosophical concepts
      - [[Virtue]], [[knowledge]], etc.
- [[Plato]] defined [[knowledge]] as [[justified true belief]]
- [[Edmund Gettier]] objected to the standard model
  - [[Gettier problem]]
- Analyzing justification
  - [[Infinite regress]]]] problem
    - Majority of our beliefs depend on other beliefs for their justification
    - This ends up being a vicious infinite regress
    - Solutions:
      - Argued against with [[foundationalism]]
        - Justification does not depend on other beliefs
      - [[Coherentism]]
        - Like a web connecting together
- [[Foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]] are interpreted as internalist ([[interalism]])
