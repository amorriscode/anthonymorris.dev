# Software Defined Networking (SDN)

![Traditional network versus SDN](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-23-12-04-38.png)

- Virtualization of network services
- SDN controller manages services instead of services being managed by hardware
- SDN controller integrates all network's virtual and physical devices into one cohesive system
- Protocols handle the process of making decisions
  - Control plane
- Physical devices make actual contact with data transmissions as they traverse the network
  - Data plane
- Advantage to separating the control plane from the data plane is to provide network technicians with more centralized control of network settings/management
- SDN creates potential to implement more sophisticated network functions with cheaper devices
- SDN architecture has been expanding to include management of network resources hosted in places other than an organization's own network
