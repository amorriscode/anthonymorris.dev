- Virtualization
  - Pros
    - Efficient use of resources
    - Cost and energy savings
    - Fault and threat isolation
    - Simple backups, recovery, and replication
  - Cons
    - Compromised performance
    - Increased complexity
    - Increased licensing costs
    - Single point of failure
- Host
  - Physical [[computer]] hosting a virtual machine
- Guest
  - Each virtual machine
- [[Hypervisor]]
- VMs software/hardware are assigned when created in the hypervisor
- [[SSL]] and [[TLS]]
  - Methods of encrypting [[TCP-IP]] transmissions
  - Both protocols work side by side
  - When a client and server establishes an SSL/TLS they establish a unique session
    - Association between client and server
    - Defined by agreement
    - Specific set of encryption techniques
  - Handshake protocol
    - Allows client and server to authenticate
    - Similar to a TCP three-way handshake
