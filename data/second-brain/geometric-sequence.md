# Geometric Sequence

- A [[sequence]] with a constant ratio between successive terms
  - The ratio tells us how to get from one term to another
- Each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant
- It's called a *geometric* series because it is like increasing dimensions in [[geometry]]

## Formula

- $ar^{n - 1}$
  - $a$ is the first term
  - $r$ is the common ratio
  - $n$ is the term you are looking for
