# Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- [[Artificial intelligence]]
	- Computers mimicking human behaviour
	- Concept created ~[[1950s]]
- [[Machine learning]]
	- Computer figures out how to achieve some tasks by analyzing large amounts of data
	- First written about in the [[1980s]] and [[1990s]]
	- Computers adapt and changed based on analysis of data
- [[Deep learning]]
	- Uses [[artificial neural network]]s
	- Subset of [[machine learning]]
	- Has multiple layers of connections
- 95% of the cost of data analytics comes from cleaning up the data
- In finance, what type of data do we want to feed into our [[AI]] systems?
- Some high frequency trading companies don't feel the need to introduce [[AI]] into their systems
	- "Our algorimthic trading doesn't need the overhead"
- Reasons for [[AI]] in finance
	- Interfacing with customers
		- Efficiency
			-  Help more people with less cost
		- Inclusion
		- Better targeting
			- Reach more people that are likely to use the services

	- Credit and insurance
	- Regulatory
		- Anti-money laundering
		- Anti-manipulation
	- Robotic process automation
		- Automate the boring stuff
	- Automated trading
