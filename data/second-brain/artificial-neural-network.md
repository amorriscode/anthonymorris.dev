# Artificial Neural Network

- [[Computer]] representation of [[knowledge]] that attempts to mimic neural networks of the [[human]] [[body]]
- We **train** neural nets
  - Process of adjusting weights and threshold values to get a desired outcome

## Compared To The Body

- Input values --> [[dendrite]]s
- Weight values --> Signals passed by [[dendrite]]s
- Computation and use of threshold value --> [[neuron]] producing a strong signal if enough of the weighted input signals are strong
