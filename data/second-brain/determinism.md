# Determinism

- Past events together with the laws of nature bring about all future events
  - All action is determined to go one specific way
  - There are no choices in acting other than the way one will act
- Laws of [[physics]] are deterministic and govern everything
  - Given the state of the [[universe]] at any one time, the laws of [[physics]] determine all of history
  - If you could rewind history and run it again from exactly from the same starting point, history would be exactly repeated
