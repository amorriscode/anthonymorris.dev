- Chapter 12: Rings, [[Moon]]s, and [[Pluto]]
  - 12.1 Ring and [[Moon]] Systems Introduced
    - Learning Objectives
      - Name the major [[moon]]s of each of the [[jovian planet]]s
      - Describe the basic composition of each [[jovian planet]]'s [[ring system]]
  - 12.2 The Galilean [[Moon]]s of [[Jupiter]]
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the major features we can observe about [[Callisto]] and what we can deduce from them
      - Explain the evidence for tectonic and volcanic activity on [[Ganymede]]
      - Explain what may be responsible for the unusual features on the icy surface of [[Europa]]
      - Describe the major distinguishing characteristics of [[Io]]
      - Explain how tidal forces generate the geological activity we see on [[Europa]] and [[Io]]
  - 12.3 [[Titan]] and [[Triton]]
    - Learning Objectives
      - Explain how the thick [[atmosphere]] of [[Titan]] makes bodies of liquid on its surface possible
      - Describe what we learned from landing on [[Titan]] with the [[Huygens probe]]
      - Discuss the features we observed on the surface of [[Triton]] when [[Voyager 2]] flew by
  - 12.4 [[Pluto]] and [[Charon]]
    - Learning objectives
      - Compare the orbital characteristics of [[Pluto]] with those of the [[planet]]s
      - Describe information about [[Pluto]]'s surface deduced from [[New Horizon]] images
      - Note some distinguishing characteristics of [[Pluto]]'s large [[moon]] [[Charon]]
  - 12.5 Planetary Rings
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the two theories of planetary ring formation
      - Compare the major rings of [[Saturn]] and explain the role of the [[moon]] [[Enceladus]] in the formation of the E ring
      - Explain how the rings of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] differ in composition and appearance from the rings of [[Saturn]]
      - Describe how ring structure is affected by the presence of [[moon]]s
- Chapter 13: [[Comet]]s and [[Asteroid]]s
  - 13.1 [[Asteroid]]s
    - Learning Objectives
      - Outline the story of the discovery of [[asteroid]]s and describe their typical [[orbit]]s
      - Describe the composition and classification of the various types of [[asteroid]]s
      - Discuss what was learned from [[space mission]]s to several [[asteroid]]s
