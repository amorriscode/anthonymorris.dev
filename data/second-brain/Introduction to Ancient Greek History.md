## Introduction
- Greeks represent the sharpest break from how civilizations normally operated
- Greeks invented the polis (city-state)
	- Republic where citizens fought their own wars and had political participation
	- Political comes from polis
- Speculative philosophy based on on reason, observation, science emerges
- After the fall of Rome it was too difficult for any one conqueror to build a vast empire
	- Cities became self-governing, eventually city-states emerge
	- "Freedom" grew in the cracks of the broken system
## The Dark Ages

	- Civilization
		- Establishment of cities
		- Cities contain people who don't provide their own support
	- ~1600 - 1100 Mycenaean period
- We have not deciphered the language ([[Linear A]]) of Minoans
- Someone is Greek if their native language was Greek
	- Talking about a culture, not a race
- Greeks came down to the Aegean sea ~2000 B.C.
- Mycenae settlements were not right on the sea (safety and security)
	- Citadel surrounded by farmland
- Lots of evidence of regular trade
- There is a unity between religion and state, led my a monarchy
	- This is the norm for humans
	- "Palace economy", the Oriental model
- The culture during this time is a lot different than the Greeks we'll see in the rest of the lectures
	- There were no laws or standards outside the king's authority
- ~1200 B.C large attacks sweep the regions
	- Civil unrest? Climate change?
	- Dorians invaded?
	- Whatever caused the fall of Mycenae, it happened quickly and was devastating
- The collapse of the Mycenaean period brings us a clean slate
- Greeks are totally illiterate from ~1100-750 B.C.
