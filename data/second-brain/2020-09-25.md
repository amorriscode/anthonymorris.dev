- **Does [[God]] exist?**
- Questions to guide the reading:
  - What is [[Anselm]]'s definition of [[God]]?
    - Is this an adequate definition?
      - Yes, it doesn't matter what we have previously thought about [[God]]
      - The definition works for [[Anselm]]'s case and that is enough
    - "We believe you are something than which nothing greater can be though [conceived]"
      - [[God]] => the greatest conceivable being
  - [[Anselm]] says he's arguing against **the fool**.
    - Why would anyone want to argue with a fool?
      - [[Anselm]]'s fool is different than you might think of as a fool
    - What does [[Anselm]] assume is the case about the fool?
      - They deny that a greatest conceivable being exists
        - The fool is an [[atheist]]
      - The fool understands what it means to speak of a greatest conceivable being
        - Understands what the words in the definition mean
        - Can conceive of such a being
  - How does [[Anselm]] argue that [[God]] exists in our understanding?
    - Arguing that there are two realms of existence
      - Understanding
      - Reality
    - What in the world does he mean by this? *(hint: pay attention to his painter analogy)*
      - When a painter thinks of an idea for a painting, it is just in their understanding
      - Once they paint it, it is in their understanding _and_ reality
        - They have made it
  - How does [[Anselm]] argue that [[God]] exist in reality, and not just in our understanding?
    - [[Reductio ad absurdum]]
    - Steps:
        1. [[God]] --> greatest conceivable being
        2. We understand what it means to speak of the greatest conceivable being
        3. We can conceive of such a being existing in reality
            - There is nothing wrong with imaging there could be a being that corresponds with the definition
            - It's not proof that the being exists
        4. If we understand what it means to speak of _x_, then _x_ exists in the understanding
        5. [[God]] exists in the understanding
        6. Suppose [[God]] exists in the understanding, but not the reality
        7. [[God]] exists in understanding alone, but can be conceived to exist in reality
        8. If something exists in understanding _alone_, but can be conceived to exist in reality, then that thing can be conceived to be greater than it actually is
        9. [[God]] can be conceived to be greater than He actually is
        10. The greatest conceivable being can be conceived to be greater than it actually is
            - Contradiction
        11. [[God]] exists in reality
    - What does this mean?
    - See if you can decipher his argument contained in the last 5 or so sentences of ch. 3
  - What example does [[Gaunilo]] raise in response to [[Anselm]]'s argument?
    - The same reasoning could be used to say that greatest conceivable island exists
      - This is absurd
    - How is this example supposed to undermine [[Anselm]]'s argument?
      - Through reason alone, it's tough to accept the argument
      - This makes [[Anselm]]'s argument to appear absurd/weak
    - What is [[Anselm]]’s response to [[Gaunilo]]?
      - The reasoning _only_ applies to the class of all conceivable beings
      - The greatest conceivable being is not bounded like an island would be
    - Existence is not a property
      - A later objection to [[Anselm]]
  - What is our textbook’s analysis of [[Anselm]]’s argument?
    - Do you think our textbook authors are being fully charitable to the argument?
- Ontological [[argument]]s
- Doe [[God]] exist?
  - [[Theist]]
    - Believes some for of a god exists
  - [[Atheist]]
    - Someone who thinks god probably (or for sure) doesn't exist
  - [[Agnostic]]
    - Someone that is not sure if a god exists
- Whatever your view is, there will always be a lot of people that don't share your beliefs
- Thinking about [[God]]...
  - Valuable from a historical perspective
  - Helpful for sharpening thoughts about our conclusions
