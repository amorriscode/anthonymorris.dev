[[astr-1101]]

- Only need to recognize Orion and the Big Dipper
- [[Constellations]]
  - You can use the Big Dipper to find [[Polaris]]
- Angular size, distance, separation
  - Apparent size measured in degrees (or radians)
  - Object in sky stretching from your zenith to the horizon would have an angular size of 90Ëš
  - Angular separation between setting [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] overhead is 90Ëš
- Apparent motion of the stars
  - Star motion impossible to see on a daily basis because they are so far away
  - Perpendicular to the horizon --> equator
  - Parallel to the horizon --> North Pole
- Early [[Greek]] and Roman cosmology
  - What they knew ~2500 years ago
  - [[Earth]] was a sphere
    - Shadow shape, changing stars as you move south
  - [[Sun]] is farther from [[Earth]] than the [[Moon]]
    - Eclipses
  - Stars seem to slowly move in regular pattern
    - [[Precession]] ([[Earth]]) wobbling
  - Thought [[Earth]] was stationary (they were wrong but moving in the right direction)
    - No [[parallax]]
  - Ranking system for magnitude of [[stars]]
    - Based on brightness

[[cpsc-1050]]

- Goals
  - Distinguish among categories of numbers
  - Describe positional notation
  - Convert numbers in other bases to base 10
  - Convert base-10 numbers to numbers in other bases
  - Describe the relationship between bases 2, 8, and 16
  - Explain the importance to computing of bases that are powers of 2
- Convert [[binary]] --> [[decimal]]
- Convert real [[decimal]] --> [[binary]]
- Perform [[binary]] addition/subtraction
- Two's compliment
- [[Number Theory]]
- [[Grace Hopper]]
