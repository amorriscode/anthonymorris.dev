- Branches:
  - Knowledge representation
    - Techniques used to represent knowledge so [[computer]] systems can apply it to [[problem solving]]
  - Expert systems
    - [[Computer]] systems that embody knowledge of [[human]] experts
  - [[Artificial Neural Network]]s
    - [[Computer]] systems that mimic the processing of the [[human]] [[brain]]
  - [[Natural language processing]]
    - Processing [[language]]s that [[human]]s use to communicate
