- Really important to get over the discomfort of cold calls and get into the market
- Presenting for phase 2
  - Valuable just to get practice presenting
  - Great to get high level feedback from folks with experience
- Need a 'one-liner'
  - Great 1-2 sentences to explain the company
  - Can be a little buzz-wordy to capture the reader
- Thinking like an investor
  - Need to be able to evaluate our own ideas
  - Put the investor lens on when looking at ourselves
  - Investors want 10x return
- Early stage investors value:
  - Strong vision
  - Compelling problem
  - Unique solution
  - Early traction
  - Market size (>$ 1 billion)
  - Well rounded team
- The Slack channel had _significantly more_ response to pitches that had stories
  - Start with story first
  - Zoom out to 1000 view after
  - People will ask for details if the story grips them
- People are very unrealistic about the urgency
  - High --> people are dying, etc.
- General presentation feedback:
  - Avoid text heavy --> utilize images
    - Pump up that font size
  - Practice pitches with children or people who know nothing about your market
  - Never assume knowledge --> pretend everyone is dumb
    - Speak clearly and slowly
  - Leave a key message at the end
  - No one remembers what you tell them, they remember how you made them **feel**
- Customer market is always evolving
