# 802.11

- WLANs work at [[physical layer]] and [[data link layer]]
- Support TCP/IP higher-layer OSI protocols and [[operating system]]s
- Most popular standard used by WLANs is wi-fi
  - Developed by IEEE's 802.11 committee
- Standards
  - 802.11b
  - 802.11a
  - 802.11g
  - 802.11n
  - 802.11ac
    - Operates on 5 GHz
    - Exceeds benchmarks set by earlier standards
    - First Wi-Fi standard to approach Gigabit Ethernet capabilities
- 802.11n and later modify the way frames are used at the MAC sublayer
  - Lower portion of the [[data link layer]]
- LLC sublayer is primarily concerned with multiplexing, flow and error control, and reliability

## Access Method

- 802.11 MAC services
  - Append 48-bit physical addresses to frame to identify source/destination
- Same physical addressing scheme as other Ethernet networks
  - Can be easily combined with IEEE networks
- Wireless devices
  - Not designed to simultaneously send/receive
  - Cannot prevent collisions
  - Different access method than Ethernet
- CSMA/CA
  - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
  - Minimizes collision potential
  - Uses ACK packets to verify every transmission
    - More overhead than 802.3
    - Real throughput is less than theoretical maximum
- RTS/CTS
  - Request to Send/Clear to Send
  - Ensures packets not inhibited by other transmissions
  - Efficient for large transmission packets
  - Decreases overall 802.11 efficiency

## Frames

![802.11 data from compared with an 802.3 Ethernet frame](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-16-15-04-02.png)

- Overhead
  - ACKs, probes, beacons
- Specifies MAC sublayer frame type
- Multiple frame type groups
  - Management frames
    - Association and re-association
  - Control frames
    - Medium access and data delivery
    - ACK and RTS/CTS frames
  - Data frames
    - Carry data sent between stations
    - Four address fields
      - Source address
      - Transmitter address
      - Receiver address
      - Destination address
    - Sequence control field
      - How large packets are fragmented
    - Error checking and fragmentation are handled at the MAC sublayer of the [[data link layer]]

## Innovations

- MIMO
  - Multiple Input Multiple Output
  - Multiple access point and client device antennas may issue signal to one or more receivers
  - Increase range and network's throughput
- MU-MIMO
  - Multiuser MIMO
  - Newer tech that allows multiple antennas to service multiple clients simultaneously
  - Reduces congestion
  - Contributes to faster data transmission
  - Available with WAVE 2 802.11ac products
- Channel bonding
  - Two adjacent 20 MHz channels can be bonded to make a 40 MHz channel
    - More than doubles bandwidth available in a single 20 MHz channel
- Frame aggregation
  - Combine multiple frames into one larger frame
  - Two techniques
    - A-MSDU (Aggregated Mac Service Data Unit)
    - A-MPDU (Aggregated Mac Protocol Data Unit)
  - Reduces overhead
