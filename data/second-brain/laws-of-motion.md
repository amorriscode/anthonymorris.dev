# Laws of Motion

1. Every object will stay in a state of rest or motion unless an outside force acts on it
   - The motion will have a constant speed
   - Restatement of [[Galileo]]'s discovery of the _conservation of [[momentum]]_
   - Sometimes called the _law of inertia_
2. Change of motion of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the force acting on it
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
   - Mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and act in opposite directions
