# Laws of Motion

- [[Isaac Newton]]'s laws

1. Every object will stay in a state of rest or [[motion]] unless an outside [[force]] acts on it
   - The [[motion]] will have a constant [[speed]]
   - Restatement of [[Galileo]]'s discovery of the *conservation of [[momentum]]*
   - Sometimes called the *law of [[inertia]]*
2. Change of [[motion]] of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the [[force]] acting on it
   - $F = ma$
   - If you want to accelerate anything, you have to apply a [[force]]
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
   - Mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and act in opposite directions
