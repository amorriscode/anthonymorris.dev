# Earth ðŸœ¨

- 13,000 kilometers in diameter
- The [[Moon]] is the nearest astronomical neighbour
  ![Earth and Moon, drawn to scale](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-06-21-03-09.png)
- The [[Sun]] is about 150 million kilometers away
  - About 400 times as far away from us as the [[Moon]]
  - This distance is an [[astronomical unit]]
- Axis of rotation is tilted 23.5Ëš
  - This is why the [[Sun]] is visible for less time in the winter and more time in the summer (in the northern hemisphere)

## Calculating Earth's Size in Ancient times

![How the Earth's size was calculated](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-10-13-32-35.png)

- In Syene, the [[Sun]] was straight overhead (no shadows created) but in Alexandria had shadows with 7Ëš
- This means at Alexandria, [[Earth]]'s surfaced has curved by 7Ëš (1/50 of a full circle)
- The distance between the two cities must then be 1/50 the [[Earth]]'s circumference, so we can measure that
