# Earth ðŸœ¨

- 13,000 kilometers in diameter
- The [[Moon]] is the nearest astronomical neighbour
  ![Earth and Moon, drawn to scale](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-06-21-03-09.png)
- The [[Sun]] is about 150 million kilometers away
  - About 400 times as far away from us as the [[Moon]]
  - This distance is an [[astronomical unit]]
- Axis of rotation is tilted 23.5Ëš
  - This is why the [[Sun]] is visible for less time in the winter and more time in the summer (in the northern hemisphere)

## Coordinate System

- Axis of rotation defines poles
- Equator is halfway between both poles
- East/west defined by Earth's rotation
  - East --> direction toward which Earth rotates
  - West --> opposite of East

## Calculating Earth's Size in Ancient times

![How the Earth's size was calculated](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-10-13-32-35.png)

- In Syene, the [[Sun]] was straight overhead (no shadows created) but in Alexandria had shadows with 7Ëš
- This means at Alexandria, [[Earth]]'s surfaced has curved by 7Ëš (1/50 of a full circle)
- The distance between the two cities must then be 1/50 the [[Earth]]'s circumference, so we can measure that

## Orbit

- Distance from the [[Sun]] only varies by ~3%

## Seasons

![Seasons](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-20-15-07.png)

- Caused by the tilt of Earth's axis (23.5Ëš)
- Depending where the Earth is in its orbit, one of the hemispheres will be more directly illuminated
- Sunlight becomes more/less effective at heating the Earth
- The [[Sun]] will actually spend more/less time above the horizon

## Time

![Sidereal Day vs Solar Day](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-20-32-28.png)

- **Solar days** are defined in terms of the Earth's rotation with respect to the [[Sun]]
  - How we tell time
  - ~4 minutes longer than a sidereal day ($\frac{1}{365}$ of a day)
  - [[Star]]s rise 4 minutes earlier every day
- **Sidereal days** are defined in terms of the Earth's rotation with respect to the [[star]]s
  - [[Star]]s rise at the same sidereal time every day
  - Better for observing the [[star]]s
- Apparent solar time
  - Time determined by the actual position of the [[Sun]]
  - Time shown on sundials
  - Not very convenient for us
  - First half of the day, the [[Sun]] has not reached the meridian
    - Before the [[Sun]] reaches the local meridian
    - _ante meridiem_ or a.m.
  - Second half of the day, after noon
    - _post meridiem_ or p.m.
    - After the [[Sun]] reaches the local meridian
- Mean solar time
  - Average value of the solar day over the year
  - Exactly 24 hours in a day
  - Progresses at a uniform rate
- Standard time
  - 24 standardized global time zones
  - Each zone keep the same standard time with the local mean solar time running through the middle of each zone
  - Travelers change their watches only when time change is >= one hour

## Tidal Force

![Tidal bulges](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-27-07-29-51.png)

- The [[Moon]] pulls on the Earth, making tidal bulges in the oceans
- Water on the side facing the [[Moon]] flows toward it
- Water on the side away from the [[Moon]] has weak influence so tides are high
- Bulges out on the side facing the [[Moon]] as well as the side facing away from it
  - This causes two high/low tides per day
  - Once when away from the [[Moon]], and once when facing it
