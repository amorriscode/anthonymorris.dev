# Earth ðŸœ¨

- ~13,000 kilometers in diameter
- [[The Moon]] is the nearest astronomical neighbour
  ![Earth and Moon, drawn to scale](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-06-21-03-09.png)
- The [[Sun]] is about 150 million kilometers away
  - About 400 times as far away from us as [[the Moon]]
  - This distance is an [[astronomical unit]]
- Axis of rotation is tilted 23.5Ëš
  - This is why the [[Sun]] is visible for less time in the winter and more time in the summer (in the northern hemisphere)
- Composed primarily of heavy elements
  - [[Iron]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]]
  - Very different from the composition of the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s

## Layers

- Separated into layers of material based on different densities
  - [[Differentiation]]

### Crust

- ~0.3% of the Earth's mass
- Various types of rock
  - [[Igneous rock]]
    - [[Basalt]] and [[granite]]
    - Rock that has cooled from a molten state
  - [[Sedimentary rock]]
    - Made up of fragments of [[igneous rock]] or shells of living organisms
  - [[Metamorphic rock]]
    - High temperature or pressure alters [[igneous rock]] or [[sedimentary rock]]
- Oceanic crust
  - Covers 55% of Earth's surface
  - Mostly submerged under oceans
  - About 6 km thick
  - Composed of volcanic rocks ([[basalt]])
- Continental crust
  - Covers 45% of the Earth's surface
  - 20-70 km thick
  - Predominately composed of [[granite]]

### Mantle

- Largest part of the solid Earth
  - Oozing flow (like [[lava]])
- Stretches from base of the crust --> 2900 km deep
- ~84% of Earth's volume
- Made of rock

### Core

- 5000 K
- 1.4 million atmospheres
  - High pressure
- Diameter of 7000 km
- Larger than the entire planet [[Mercury]]
- Outer core is liquid
  - 1200 km
- Inner core is probably solid
  - 3400 km
  - Spinning
  - [[Iron]] and [[nickel]]

## Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere

![Earth's Magnetosphere](/assets/second-brain/2020-11-02-08-19-07.png)

- Magnetic field generated by moving material in the liquid metallic core
- Extends into surrounding space
- Magnetosphere
  - The zone within which Earth's magnetic field dominates over the weak interplanetary magnetic field that extends outward from the [[Sun]]
  - Extends ~60,000 km in the direction of the [[Sun]]
  - Can reach as far as the orbit of [[the Moon]] on the side opposite the [[Sun]]

## Atmosphere

![Structure of the atmosphere](/assets/second-brain/2020-11-02-08-55-11.png)

- About a millionth of the total mass of Earth
- Consists of:
  - 78% [[nitrogen]]
  - 21% [[oxygen]]
  - 1% [[argon]]
  - Traces of [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]]
- Absorbs/blocks certain [[electromagnetic radiation]]
  - ![Electromagnetic radiation and our atmosphere](/assets/second-brain/2021-01-19-10-38-33.png)

### Atmospheric Layers

- [[Ionosphere]]
- [[Mesosphere]]
- [[Stratosphere]]
- [[Troposphere]]

### Greenhouse Effect

- Trapping of [[infrared ray]]s
- Visible light comes through, converted to heat, and then cannot escape

## Coordinate System

- Axis of rotation defines poles
- Equator is halfway between both poles
- East/west defined by Earth's rotation
  - East --> direction toward which Earth rotates
  - West --> opposite of East

## Calculating Earth's Size in Ancient times

![How the Earth's size was calculated](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-10-13-32-35.png)

- In Syene, the [[Sun]] was straight overhead (no shadows created) but in Alexandria had shadows with 7Ëš
- This means at Alexandria, [[Earth]]'s surfaced has curved by 7Ëš (1/50 of a full circle)
- The distance between the two cities must then be 1/50 the [[Earth]]'s circumference, so we can measure that

## Orbit

- Distance from the [[Sun]] only varies by ~3%

## Seasons

![Seasons](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-20-15-07.png)

- Caused by the tilt of Earth's axis (23.5Ëš)
- Depending where the Earth is in its orbit, one of the hemispheres will be more directly illuminated
  - Sunlight becomes more/less effective at heating the Earth
  - Tilting towards the [[Sun]] provides more direct sunlight
  - Longer days gives the [[Sun]] more time to heat up the Earth
- The [[Sun]] will actually spend more/less time above the horizon
    ![Sun's path in the sky depending on the season](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-20-17-19.png)

## Time

![Sidereal Day vs Solar Day](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-26-20-32-28.png)

- **Solar days** are defined in terms of the Earth's rotation with respect to the [[Sun]]
  - How we tell time
  - ~4 minutes longer than a sidereal day ($\frac{1}{365}$ of a day)
  - [[Star]]s rise 4 minutes earlier every day
- **Sidereal days** are defined in terms of the Earth's rotation with respect to the [[star]]s
  - [[Star]]s rise at the same sidereal time every day
  - Better for observing the [[star]]s
- Apparent solar time
  - Time determined by the actual position of the [[Sun]]
  - Time shown on sundials
  - Not very convenient for us
  - First half of the day, the [[Sun]] has not reached the [[meridian]]
    - Before the [[Sun]] reaches the local [[meridian]]
    - _ante meridiem_ or a.m.
  - Second half of the day, after noon
    - _post meridiem_ or p.m.
    - After the [[Sun]] reaches the local [[meridian]]
- Mean solar time
  - Average value of the solar day over the year
  - Exactly 24 hours in a day
  - Progresses at a uniform rate
- Standard time
  - 24 standardized global time zones
  - Each zone keep the same standard time with the local mean solar time running through the middle of each zone
  - Travelers change their watches only when time change is >= one hour

## Tidal Force

![Tidal bulges](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-27-07-29-51.png)

- Not a _real_ force like [[gravity]]
  - Differential [[gravity]]
- [[The Moon]] pulls on the Earth, making tidal bulges in the oceans
- Water on the side facing [[the Moon]] flows toward it
- Water on the side away from [[the Moon]] has weak influence so tides are high
- Bulges out on the side facing [[the Moon]] as well as the side facing away from it
  - This causes two high/low tides per day
  - Once when away from [[the Moon]], and once when facing it
