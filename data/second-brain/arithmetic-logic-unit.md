# Arithmetic Logic Unit

- Mathematical brain --> all computation
- [[Computer]] component that performs arithmetic and logical operations
  - Arithmetic ops:
    - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
  - Logical ops:
    - Comparison of two values, etc.
    - [[Logic gate]] functionality (AND, OR, etc.)
- Operates in words
  - 16, 32, 64 bits
- Have special storage units called **registers**
  - Used to store intermediate values or special data
  - Can compute things faster without having to interact with memory
