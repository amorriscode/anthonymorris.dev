# Mercury ☿

- Temperature ranges from 280-430˚ on sunlit site
- We don't have a lot of data about Mercury
  - So close to the [[Sun]]
- Heavily cratered
- Closest [[planet]] to the [[Sun]]
  - Shorted period of revolution around the [[Sun]] (88 days)
- Similar to [[the Moon]]
- Smallest terrestrial [[planet]]

## Composition

- Mantle and crust was probably stripped off by an impact in the early formation of [[the Solar System]]
- Composed of heavier materials
  - Evident based on its [[density]]

## Atmosphere/Exosphere

- No appreciable [[atmosphere]]
  - Was too small and hot to retain its gas
- Has an [[exosphere]]
