# Polynomial

- An [[expression]] consisting of [[variable]]s and [[coefficient]]s
  - Examples
    - $x^2 - 4x + 7$
    - $x^3 - 2xyz^2 - yz + 1$
- Involves only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative [[integer]] exponentiation of [[variable]]s

## Degrees

- The **degree** of a polynomial $P(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ found in $P(x)$
  - $x^2 - 4x + 7$ has a degree of $2$
- There is no formula to give us solutions for quintic degree polynomials

|            | Degree | Form                                 |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Linear     | 1      | $ax + b$                             |
| Quadratic  | 2      | $ax^2 + bx + c$                      |
| Cubic      | 3      | $ax^3 + bx^3 + cx + d$               |
| Quartic    | 4      | $ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e$        |
| Quintic    | 5      | $ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f$ |
| 6th degree | 6      | ...                                  |
| 7th degree | 7      | ...                                  |
