- [[Patrick Collison]]
- [[Sam Bankman-Fried]]
- [[Bitcoin]] vs. [[gold]]
	- Inflation is not up this year, just measures of inflation
- Is crypto good or bad for the dollar?
	- It's complicated
	- All digital assets provide ways for fiat "rails" to be cleaner and more efficient than they are today
	- Hopefully digit assets will put pressure on poorly built fiat systems and support well built ones
- Building a busy has a lot of messy parts
	- You need to be able to effectively manage the messy parts
	- The world is messy everywhere; nothing works the way it says it does
- Sam guesses annonymous cryptocurrencies will likely be seen as problamatic in the coming years
	- eg. [[Monero]], [[ZCash]]
	- KYC
	- Selective privacy solutions might be preferable
- Smaller, more nible countires can more easily adopt pro-crypto legislation
- Blockchain applications
	- Interoperability between platforms --> bullish case
	- Bad for platforms, consumers, and society,
		- Breaking into the industry becomes non-practical
- In general, people are too risk averse
	- Specifically when it comes to things that are altruistic
- FTX has fewer than 30 software engineers
	- Companies should only grow their engineering team if they know what to do with them and how to integrate them
- Predictors of success for FTX employees (unique or important to FTX):
	- Being able to handle messy worlds well
		- How much do you care about beautiful code?
			- f you refuse to work in messy code you won't cut it
			- Sometimes you have to improve, do the best you can, and iterate
		- Make reasonable tradeoffs given the messiness
	- Working well with colleagues
		- You can't hire assholes, even if they are brilliant --> ends up bad
		- Intelligence is an important predictor but not overwhelmingly so
			- ~20-30% of what matters
			- Not as important as their willingness to work hard, their ability to be good a colleague, or being aligned with the company
- [[Utilitarianism]]
	- Expected utility ethics
	- You should do the actions that maximize the utility of the world
- [[Effective Altruism]]
	- Biggest blindspot
		- EAs were originally too concerned with problems that were clean stories
			- Things they were able to measure directly
		- Haven't been solving big messy problems
