# Principle of Equivalence

- The idea that free fall is indistinguishable from, and therefore equivalent to, zero [[gravity]]
- [[Albert Einstein]] used this principle to develop his changes to [[Isaac Newton]]'s idea of [[gravity]]
- No experiment can distinguish between:
  - [[Acceleration]] and [[gravity]]
  - Free fall and zero g
