# St Thomas Aquinas

## God's Existence

- Argued for [[God]]'s existence with a [[cosmological argument]]
- Definitions
  - Effect --> something that has come to exist
  - Efficient cause --> something that brings an effect about (causes it to exist)
  - [[God]] --> first, uncaused efficient cause
    - If [[God]] is uncaused (not an effect), [[God]] must be something that did not _begin_ to exist
    - [[God]] has _always_ existed
- Used process of elimination for existence of a first cause
  - Four possibilities
    - Regress has no end, it's infinite
    - Regress has no end, it's circular
    - Regress does have an end, something causes itself
    - Regress does have an end, there's a first cause (that is uncaused)
  - St Thomas Aquinas argues the first three possibilities are not possible therefore, [[God]] is the first cause

### Argument

- Deductive [[argument]]
- Phase 1
  - There are causes and effects in the world
    - Not everything has a cause but _every effect has a cause_
  - In finite time, it's impossible to get through an infinite number of causes
    - No effect would ever be reached
    - There cannot be infinite causal regresses
- Phase 2
  - Causes must precede its effect
    - There cannot be circular
    - There cannot be self-caused
- Phase 3
  - We cannot have infinite, circular, or self-causation
  - The must be a first uncaused cause
- Phase 4
  - Definition of [[God]] --> first, uncaused cause
  - [[God]] exists
