- Hertzspring-Russell diagram
  - Named after [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]]
- Plots [[luminosity]] on the $y$-axis
  - [[Luminosity]] increases toward the top
- Plots either [[temperature]] or spectral type on the $x$-axis
  - [[Temperature]] increases towards the left
- [[Main sequence star]]s represent a relationship between [[temperature]] and [[luminosity]] that most [[star]]s follow
  - A band running from upper left (hot, more luminous) to the lower right (cool, less luminous)
  - Hotter [[star]]s are more luminous than cooler ones
  - More massive [[star]]s are hotter than less massive ones
    - More [[mass]] --> more [[gravity]] --> greater compression at their core
    - Greater compression at the core leads to better [[energy]] generation and thus more luminosity and heat
- Can be used to measure the distance of [[star]]s
  - See Measuring Distance from [[Earth]] here: [[star]]
  - Anchored by measurements of [[parallax]]
