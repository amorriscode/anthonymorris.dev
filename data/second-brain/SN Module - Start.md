# Shift Nudge - Start
- Mindset
	- Be prepped for learning
	- Move from dismissive to curious
	- Focus on the fundamentals
	- Prep for concentration and hard work
- Product thinking tips
	- Love the problem, not the solution
	- Probe deep on the problem --> don't offer solutions immediately
	- Embrace and explore uncertainty
- A problem and solution shouldn't contain information about the app or website
	- Food delivery app's problem: "Person X is at home and very hungry with nothing to eat."
	- Food delivery app's solution: "Person X now has food and is no longer hungry."
	- UI is everything that happens between the problem and solution

## Design Process
- Use a process so you don't get bogged down in the details

1. Understand the problem
2. Determine complexity
3. Use lists, content maps, and user flows to guide the project
	- Requirements for the UI
	- User journey
4. Wireframe (or not) based on complexity
	- Mobile wireframes force you to think more simply
5. Set design direction
6. Present early and often
7. Explore, iterate, and exploit
8. Systematize

## Using Reference Material
- Useful to get started
- Be careful not to rip anything off --> pixel by pixel copying, etc.
- Use only one thing from a design --> eg. just typography
	- If something is too specific to a brand, don't take from it
- A good approach would be to just make a list of things you like from a design then never look at the design again
	- Put away the design when you're doing implementation
