# Arguments

- An attempt to justify a conclusion by rational means
- Set of statements consisting of:
  - One or more premises (supporting statements)
  - A conclusion (statement in need of support)
- A bad argument can have a true conclusion
- "Is this a good argument?" !== "Do you agree with the conclusion?"

## Forms of Arguments

- [[Deductive argument]]s
- Non-deductive arguments
  - Tries to provide probable support for its conclusion
    - A conclusion should seem _more likely_ to be true
    - Not definitive truth
  - A non-deductive argument providing probable support is **strong**
    - Strength comes in degrees
  - A **strong** argument with true premises is **cogent**
    - Cogency runs parallel to soundness
    - Cogent arguments can have false conclusions
  - Types
    - [[Inductive argument]]s
    - [[Abuctive argument]]s
    - [[Analogical argument]]s
- [[Ontological argument]]s

## Reconstructing Arguments

- Piece together an argument from a passage of text
- There may be missing pieces
  - Hidden premises or conclusions
  - Can happen due to various reasons:
    - Lazy author
    - Think premise(s) are obvious
- Look for a conclusion indicator (eg. _so_)
- How to find missing premises
  - Search for credible premise that would make argument valid (or as strong as possible)
  - Choose premise that is:
    - Most plausible
    - Fits best with author's intent
    - Principle of Clarity
      - Always attribute the _strongest_ possible interpretation of an author's position consistent with the text

## Evaluating Arguments

- Think about two questions:
  - Are the premises of this argument true?
  - Assuming the premises are true, to what extend do they support the conclusion?
- Look out for faulty reasoning
  - A [[fallacy]]
  - Error in reasoning that commonly persuades people
