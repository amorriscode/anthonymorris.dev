# Sun

- Diameter is about 1.5 million kilometers
- [[Orbit]]s around the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] around 225-250 million terrestrial years
  - Known as a **galactic** or **cosmic** years
- Follows the **ecliptic** on the [[celestial sphere]]
- Accounts for 98.6% of the [[Solar System]]'s mass
  - 98% of its mass is [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Surface temperature is ~5800 kelvin
- Energy produce with [[fusion]]
  - [[Hydrogen]] --> [[helium]]
- Brighter than ~80% of the stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]

- [Motions of the Sun Simulator](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.html)
- Rises East --> sets West
- Depending on the time of year, we can use the altitude to calculate the Sun's position in the sky
- Maximum height when crossing the meridian at local noon
- Local noon
  - Northern hemisphere --> due south
  - Southern hemisphere --> due north
  - Equator --> either north or south depending on time of year
- Declination ranges between -23.5Ëš and +23.5Ëš

## Atmosphere

![Layers of the Sun](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-23-14-09-33.png)

- **Photosphere**
  - First/deepest layer of the atmosphere
  - The sphere of light
    - Light we see from the Sun comes from this layer
  - 400 km thick
  - Gives the Sun an apparent surface
    - Boundary between interior and atmosphere of the Sun
  - Granular surface
    - Granules ~1000 km in size
      - Dark rings around granule are cooler spots
    - Several million granules cover the solar surface
    - Lifetime of one granule is only 5-10 minutes
- **Chromosphere**
  - Sphere of colour
    - Gives sun a reddish glow due to emission of [[hydrogen]] spectral lines
  - Roughly 2000 km thick
  - ~10,000 K
    - Hotter than the photosphere
  - **Spicules**
    - Long thing fingers of luminous gas which appear like blades of a huge field of fiery grass
    - Rise to the top of the chromosphere and then sink back down
  - Contain **plages**
    - Bright regions around sunspots
    - Areas within chromosphere with higher temperature and density than their surroundings
- **Transit region**
  - 10,000 K - nearly a million degrees
  - Where the temperature rises rapidly
- **Corona**
  - Several million kilometres above the chromosphere
  - Very hot
    - Million degrees or more
  - Heated by Sun's magnetic field
  - 10 trillion times less dense than the sea level atmosphere on [[Earth]]
  - Gases in this layer get blown into space
  - Emits about half as much light as the full moon
    - Only seen during an [[eclipse]] because the photosphere overpowers it

## Composition

- Spectroscopic data analyzed in 1925 helped confirm composition
  - People originally believed it must be [[Earth]]-like
  - Analyzed by [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]
- Mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
  - ~73% [[hydrogren]]
  - ~25% helium
- Most elements are in the form of atoms
  - So much heat, many of the atoms are _ionized_
    - Stripped of one or more of their electrons
      - Large quantity of free electrons and positively charged ions
      - An electrically charged environment
    - Hot ionized gas --> plasma
- [[Proton-proton Chain]]
- Core
  - Extremely dense
  - Source of all its energy
  - Approximately 20% of the interior
  - Temperature of 15 million K
    - Hottest part of the Sun
- Radiative zone
  - [[Photon]]s carry [[energy]] and hit particles transferring [[energy]]
  - How [[energy]] goes from inside --> outside
  - Light from the core is transported through this zone very slowly
    - High density
    - Photons encounter other particles and change direction or lose some energy
- Convective zone
  - Hot blobs of gas moving out`
  - Outermost layer of the interior
- [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]]

## Prominences, Flares, and Coronal Mass Ejections

- **Prominences**
  - Usually originate near sunspots
  - Look like loops or eruptions from the surface
- **Solar flares**
  - Most violent event on the Sun's surface
  - Rapid eruption lasting 5-10 minutes
  - Releases a total amount of energy equal to that of a million [[hydrogen]] bombs
- **Coronal mass ejection**
  - Mostly protons and electrons released from the corona
  - Speeds between 500-1000 km per second
