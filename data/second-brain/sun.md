# Sun

- Diameter is about 1.5 million kilometers
- [[Orbit]]s around the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] around 225-250 million terrestrial years
  - Known as a **galactic** or **cosmic** years
- Follows the **ecliptic** on the [[celestial sphere]]
- Accounts for 98.6% of the [[Solar System]]'s mass
  - 98% of its mass is [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Surface temperature is ~5800 kelvin
- Energy produce with [[fusion]]
  - [[Hydrogen]] --> [[helium]]
- Brighter than ~80% of the stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]

- [Motions of the Sun Simulator](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.html)
- Rises East --> sets West
- Depending on the time of year, we can use the altitude to calculate the Sun's position in the sky
- Maximum height when crossing the meridian at local noon
- Local noon
  - Northern hemisphere --> due south
  - Southern hemisphere --> due north
  - Equator --> either north or south depending on time of year
- Declination ranges between -23.5Ëš and +23.5Ëš

## Atmosphere

- [[Photosphere]]
- [[Chromosphere]]
- [[Transit region]]
- [[Corona]]

## Composition

- Spectroscopic data analyzed in 1925 helped confirm composition
  - People originally believed it must be [[Earth]]-like
  - Analyzed by [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]
- Mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
  - ~73% [[hydrogren]]
  - ~25% helium
- Most elements are in the form of atoms
  - So much heat, many of the atoms are _ionized_
    - Stripped of one or more of their electrons
      - Large quantity of free electrons and positively charged ions
      - An electrically charged environment
    - Hot ionized gas --> plasma
- [[Proton-proton Chain]]
- **Core**
  - Extremely dense
  - Source of all its energy
  - Approximately 20% of the interior
  - Temperature of 15 million K
    - Hottest part of the Sun
- **Radiative zone**
  - [[Photon]]s carry [[energy]] and hit particles transferring [[energy]]
  - How [[energy]] goes from inside --> outside
  - Light from the core is transported through this zone very slowly
    - High density
    - Photons encounter other particles and change direction or lose some energy
- **Convective zone**
  - Hot blobs of gas moving out
  - Outermost layer of the interior
- [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]]

## Prominences, Flares, and Coronal Mass Ejections

- **Prominences**
  - Usually originate near sunspots
  - Look like loops or eruptions from the surface
  - Ionized gas
- **Solar flares**
  - Most violent event on the Sun's surface
  - Rapid eruption lasting 5-10 minutes
  - Releases a total amount of energy equal to that of a million [[hydrogen]] bombs
- **Coronal mass ejection**
  - Mostly protons and electrons released from the corona
  - Speeds between 500-1000 km per second

## Energy

- Outputs about $4 \times 10^{25}$ [[watt]]s of energy
- When [[Albert Einstein]] discovered that mass can be considered energy, and converted into energy, the mysteries behind the Sun's power were unlocked
