# Sun

- Diameter is about 1.5 million kilometers
- [[Orbit]]s around the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] around 225-250 million terrestrial years
  - Known as a **galactic** or **cosmic** years
- Follows the [[ecliptic]] on the [[celestial sphere]]
- Accounts for 98.6% of the [[Solar System]]'s [[mass]]
  - 98% of its [[mass]] is [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Surface temperature is ~5800 kelvin
- [[Energy]] produce with [[fusion]]
  - [[Hydrogen]] --> [[helium]]
- Brighter than ~80% of the [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]

- [Motions of the Sun Simulator](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.html)
- Rises East --> sets West
- Depending on the time of year, we can use the altitude to calculate the Sun's position in the sky
- Maximum height when crossing the meridian at local noon
- Local noon
  - [[Northern hemisphere]] --> due south
  - [[Southern hemisphere]] --> due north
  - [[Equator]] --> either north or south depending on time of year
- Declination ranges between -23.5˚ and +23.5˚

## Atmosphere

- [[Photosphere]]
- [[Chromosphere]]
- [[Transit region]]
- [[Corona]]

## Composition

- Spectroscopic data analyzed in 1925 helped confirm composition
  - People originally believed it must be [[Earth]]-like
  - Analyzed by [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]
    - She suggested the [[Sun]] was composed mainly of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
  - ~73% [[hydrogen]]
  - ~25% [[helium]]
- Most [[element]]s are in the form of [[atom]]s
  - So much heat, many of the [[atom]]s are *ionized*
    - Stripped of one or more of their [[electron]]s
      - Large quantity of free [[electron]]s and positively charged ions
      - An electrically charged environment
    - Hot ionized [[gas]] --> plasma
- [[Proton-proton Chain]]
  - Only happens in the centre of the Sun
- [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]]

### Core

- Extremely dense
- Source of all its [[energy]]
- Approximately 20% of the interior
- Temperature of 15 million K
  - Hottest part of the Sun

### Radiative Zone

- [[Photon]]s carry [[energy]] and hit particles transferring [[energy]]
- How [[energy]] goes from inside --> outside
- Light from the core is transported through this zone very slowly
  - High density
  - Photons encounter other particles and change direction or lose some [[energy]]

### Convective zone

- Hot blobs of [[gas]] moving out
- Outermost layer of the interior

## Solar Activity

- [[Prominence]]s
- [[Solar flare]]s
- [[Coronal mass ejection]]

## [[Energy]]

- Outputs about $4 \times 10^{25}$ [[watt]]s of [[energy]]
- When [[Albert Einstein]] discovered that [[mass]] can be considered [[energy]], and converted into [[energy]], the mysteries behind the Sun's power were unlocked
