# Sun

- Diameter is about 1.5 million kilometers
- [[Orbit]]s around the center of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] around 225-250 million terrestrial years
  - Known as a **galactic** or **cosmic** years
- Follows the **ecliptic** on the [[celestial sphere]]
- Accounts for 98.6% of the [[Solar System]]'s mass
  - 98% of its mass is [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- Surface temperature is ~5800 kelvin
- Energy produce with [[fusion]]
  - [[Hydrogen]] --> [[helium]]
- Brighter than ~80% of the stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]

- [Motions of the Sun Simulator](https://astro.unl.edu/naap/motion3/animations/sunmotions.html)
- Rises East --> sets West
- Depending on the time of year, we can use the altitude to calculate the Sun's position in the sky
- Maximum height when crossing the meridian at local noon
- Local noon
  - Northern hemisphere --> due south
  - Southern hemisphere --> due north
  - Equator --> either north or south depending on time of year
- Declination ranges between -23.5Ëš and +23.5Ëš

## Atmosphere

- Photosphere
  - First/deepest layer of the atmosphere
  - The sphere of light
    - Light we see from the Sun comes from this layer
  - 400 km thick
  - Gives the Sun an apparent surface
    - Boundary between interior and atmosphere of the Sun
  - Granular surface
    - Granules ~1000 km in size
      - Dark rings around granule are cooler spots
    - Several million granules cover the solar surface
- Chromosphere
  - Sphere of colour
    - Gives sun a reddish glow due to emission of [[hydrogen]] spectral lines
  - Roughly 2000 km thick
  - Spicules
    - Long thing fingers of luminous gas which appear like blades of a huge field of fiery grass
    - Rise to the top of the chromosphere and then sink back down
- Corona
  - Several million kilometres above the chromosphere
  - Very hot
    - ~10000 K at the top
  - Heated by Sun's magnetic field
  - 10 trillion times less dense than the sea level atmosphere on [[Earth]]
  - Gases in this layer get blown into space

## Composition

- Spectroscopic data analyzed in 1925 helped confirm composition
  - People originally believed it must be [[Earth]]-like
  - Analyzed by [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]
- Mostly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]
- [[Proton-proton Chain]]
- Core
  - Where everything happens
- Radiative zone
  - [[Photon]]s carry [[energy]] and hit particles transferring [[energy]]
  - How [[energy]] from inside --> outside
- Convective zone
  - Hot blobs of gas moving up
- [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]]
