- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model
  - Seven-layer model
- Describes how applications communicate over the network
- Typically described from top --> down
- Meant to make developing communication products easier

## Layers

- Lower two layers form the foundation of the [[Internet]]
  - Other protocols deal with specific types of network communication
- Application, Presentation, and Session layers are often intertwined
  - Can be hard to distinguish between them

1. [[Physical layer]]
2. [[Data link layer]]
3. [[Network layer]]
4. [[Transport layer]]
5. [[Session layer]]
6. [[Presentation layer]]
7. [[Application layer]]

## Protocol Data Unit (PDU)

- Technical name for bits moving from one layer to the next
