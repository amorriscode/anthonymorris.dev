- **Chapter 18**
  - **18.1: A Stellar Census**
    - Learning Objectives
      - Explain why the [[star]]s visible to the unaided [[eye]] are not typical
      - Describe the distribution of stellar masses found close to the [[Sun]]
    - A stellar census is hard because
      - We may not count *all* inhabitants
      - Our local neighbourhood may not include all possible types of [[star]]s
  - **18.2: Measuring Stellar Masses**
    - Learning Objectives
      - Distinguish the different types of [[binary star]] systems
      - Understand how we can apply [[Isaac Newton]]'s version of [[Johannes Kepler]]'s third law to derive the sum of [[star]] masses in a [[binary star]] system
      - Apply the relationship between stellar mass and stellar luminosity to determine the physical characteristics of a [[star]]
  - **18.3: Diameters of [[Star]]s**
    - Learning Objectives
      - Describe the methods used to determine [[star]] diameters
      - Identify the parts of an eclipsing [[binary star]] light curve that correspond to the diameters of the individual components
  - **18.4: The H-R Diagram**
    - Learning Objectives
      - Identify the physical characteristics of [[star]]s that are used to create an [[H-R diagram]]
        - Describe how those characteristics vary among groups of [[star]]s
      - Discuss the physical properties of most [[star]]s found at different locations on the [[H-R diagram]]
        - Such as radius, [[mass]], etc.
