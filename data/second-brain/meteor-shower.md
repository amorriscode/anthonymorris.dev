# Meteor Shower

- Sudden burst of [[meteor]] activity
- [[Earth]] passing through [[comet]] debris
  - The dust is not always evenly distributed along the [[comet]]'s [[orbit]] so some years more [[meteor]]s are seen
- Come from their **radiant**
  - ![Radiant of a meteor shower](/assets/second-brain/2020-12-04-12-13-43.png)
  - Direction in space from which the [[meteor]] stream seems to be diverging
  - Designated by the [[constellation]] in which the radiant is located
- No [[meteorite]]s have ever been recovered from a meteor shower
