# To Laugh Often

>To laugh often and much;
>to win the respect of the intelligent people
>and the affection of children;
>to earn the appreciation of honest critics
>and endure the betrayal of false friends;
>to appreciate beauty;
>to find the best in others;
>to leave the world a bit better
>whether by a healthy child, a garden patch
>or a redeemed social condition;
>to know that one life has breathed easier
>because you lived here.
>This is to have succeeded.
