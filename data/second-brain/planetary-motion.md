# Planetary Motion

- Path of an object through space is called an [[orbit]]
- [[Ptolemy]]'s [[geocentric model]] was accepted until [[Copernicus]]' [[heliocentric model]] finally got adopted

## [[Johannes Kepler]]'s Three Laws of [[Orbit]]s

1. Each planet [[orbit]]s the [[Sun]] in an [[ellipse]]
   - Circular [[orbit]]s didn't fit the observations made by [[Tycho Brahe]]
   - Discovered [[orbit]]s had a flattened shape ([[ellipse]])
   - [[Sun]] is at one focus of the [[ellipse]]
2. Straight line joining a planet and the [[Sun]] sweeps out equal areas in space and equal areas in time
   - Eg. in 60 days a planet will move the same amount of area, no matter how close it is to the body it orbits
   - The Law of Equal Areas
   - ![The Law of Equal Areas](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-12-08-51-35.png)
   - Discovered by observing [[orbit]]s speeding up as a planet gets closer to the [[Sun]]
   - Consequence of the conservation of [[angular momentum]]
   - _Figure skater law_
3. A planet's orbital period ($P$) squared is proportional to the semi-major axis ($a$) of its orbit cubed
   - $P^2 \propto a^3$
   - When $P$ is measured in years and $a$ is measured in [[astronomical unit]]s, the two sides are equal
   - Applies to all objects orbiting the [[Sun]]
   - Provides means for calculating objects relative distances from the [[Sun]]

### Newton's Addition to the Third Law

- [[Isaac Newton]] realized that the [[Sun]]'s mass and a planets mass come into play with regards to the third law
- The proper formula is $a^3 = (M_1 + M_2) \times P^2$
  - $M_1$ is the [[mass]] of the [[Sun]]
  - $M_2$ is the [[mass]] of the planet
  - Both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are expressed in units of the [[Sun]]'s [[mass]]
