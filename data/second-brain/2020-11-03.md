      - For others to make changes
      - For others to reason about the code
    - Boy-scout rule

[[phil-1101]]

- Justifying UN
  - Uniform nature
- What kind of proposition is UN?
  - Matter of fact?
  - Relation of ideas?
  - Both?
  - Neither?
  - **An unobserved matter of fact**
- Need to argue for uniformity of nature [[a posteriori]]
- It doesn't look like we can appeal to UN to justify our opinions about unobserved matters of fact
  - Circular justification
- The problem of induction
- Two useful aliens
  - The Cautious Martian
    - The Martian and us share a common body of experience
      - The Martian agrees:
        - In our experience thus far, snow has always been found to be cold
      - But the Martian _doesn't_ infer:
        - All snow is cold
        - The next piece of snow we examine will be cold
    - The Martian is agnostic about whether nature is uniform
      - Maybe we just haven't found the warm snow yet
  - The Counterinductivist
    - Like the Cautious Martian except they think nature is misleading
    - Denies that nature is uniform
    - Accepts the following principle:
      - If a regularity holds in my experience so far, it likely does _not_ hold in nature generally, not even in the next instance
    - Past regularity is evidence _against_ uniform nature
- [[David Hume]]'s skeptical solution
  - All reasoning about unobserved matters of fact are founded on the principle of custom or habit
    - Constant conjunction
    - Custom or habit --> instinct
  - "Naturalistic" explanation
    - Attempts to explain human behaviour in terms of the same processes that govern the rest of nature
    - Do not invoke any supernatural explanations, etc.
  - Interpretations
    1. He's claiming our beliefs about matters of fact are _not_ justified
    2. He's just raising the issue and is agnostic about the solution
    3. He's claiming our beliefs _are_ justified, but only in a minimal sense
       - Claiming our acceptance of UN is:
         - Non-rational
         - Not irrational
         - Not optional
       - Being justified in our beliefs depends on the type of being we are
- Other responses to [[David Hume]]
  - Strawson
    - It's impossible to justify induction in terms of anything more fundamental
    - Induction is so basic to reasoning, it doesn't need any justification
    - _Any_ successful method of uncovered, unobserved matters is a method that necessarily assumes induction
  - Popper
    - It's not actually required for successful reasoning about unobserved matters of fact

- Galilean Moons presentation
  - Mini [[solar system]]
  - Orbiting [[Jupiter]]
  - Io
    - 400 active [[volcano]]es
    - Yellow
    - Inner most moon
    - Most volcanically active object in [[the Solar System]]
      - Caused by [[Jupiter]]'s massive size
      - Elliptical [[orbit]] --> tidal heating
  - [[Europa]]
    - Possibility of life
    - Frozen
      - Due to distance from [[Jupiter]]
    - Full of surface fractures
      - Caused by tidal heating
    - Importance:
      - Ocean exists beneath the surface
      - Has a magnetic field
      - Tidal heating
      - Small concentration of oxygen
      - Could have life under its surface
  - [[Ganymede]]
    - 9th largest object in [[the Solar System]]
      - Biggest moon in [[the Solar System]]
    - Dark and bright terrain
      - Dark
