# ACID transaction

- Type of [[database]] transaction with four properties:
  - **Atomicity**
    - Operations will either succeed or fail
  - **Consistency**
    - Transactions cannot bring the [[database]] into an invalid state
  - **Isolation**
    - Execution of multiple transactions concurrently will have the same effect as if they had been executed sequentially
  - **Durability**
    - Any committed transaction is written to non-volatile storage
    - Will not be undone by a crash, power loss, etc.
