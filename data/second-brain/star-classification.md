# Star Classification

## Spectral Classification

- Originally we used a system based on the strength of [[hydrogen]] absorption lines
  - Devised by [[Williamina Fleming]]
  - Strongest [[hydrogen]] lines were A --> O
  - [[Hydrogen]] lines alone are not that useful for classification
- A new system was introduced based on decreasing [[temperature]]
  - Introduced by [[Annie Jump Cannon]]
  - Each class is further subdivided into 10 subclasses
    - Using numbers 0 through 9
  - [[Mnemonic]] for remembering:
    - **O**h **B**e **A** **F**ine **G**irl, **K**iss **M**e

## Luminosity Classes

- A classification of a [[star]] according to its [[luminosity]]
- Ia
  - Brightest [[supergiant star]]s
- Ib
