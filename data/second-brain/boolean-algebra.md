# Boolean Algebra

- Invented by [[George Boole]]
- Functions only take `0` or `1` as input

## Laws

| Property        | And                    | Or                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Commutative     | AB = BA                | A + B = B + A             |
| Associative     | (AB)C = A(BC)          | (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) |
| Distributive    | A(B + C) = (AB) + (AC) | A + (BC) = (A + B)(A + C) |
| Identity        | A1 = A                 | A + 0 = A                 |
| Complement      | A(A') = 0              | A + (A') = 1              |
| De Morgan's Law | (AB)' = A' + B'        | (A + B)' = A'B'           |
