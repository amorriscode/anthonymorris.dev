# Telescope

- Bigger is better
  - Bad for glass refractors
    - Hard to make
    - Weight causes sagging
    - Air bubbles distort
    - Opaque at some wavelengths
  - Largest visible-light telescopes today have 8 to 10 meter mirrors
- On ground
  - Stable, controlled
  - Bigger dishes
  - Atmospheric blurring
- In space
  - No atmosphere
  - Expensive
  - Difficult to maintain

## Refactor Telescopes

- Uses a lens to gather and focus light
- First telescopes built
- Advantages
  - Rugged
  - Rarely needs cleaning (glass is sealed inside)
  - Tube is closed off from outside air so air/temperature has less impact
- Disadvantages
  - Chromatic aberration
    - Colour deviation or distortion

## Reflecting Telescopes

![Types of reflecting telescopes](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-13-14-21-50.png)

- Usually have two mirrors
  - Primary
  - Secondary
- Configurations
  - Newtonian
  - Cassegrain
  - Nasmyth/CoudÃ©
    - Commonly used as professional telescopes
- Advantages
  - No chromatic aberration
    - All wavelengths of light reflect off the mirror the same
  - Easily made to be big
  - Cheaper than refractors of the same size
  - Only one side of the objective needs to be perfect (reflecting vs. passing through)
- Disadvantages
  - Easy to get optics out of alignment
  - Optics need frequent cleaning
  - Two mirrors --> can produce diffraction effects
    - "Christmas star" effect

## Radio Telescopes

- [[Radio waves]]
- Observe at any time of the day
- Wire meshes or dishes
  - Parabolic shape focuses the light to a single point
- Large because radio [[wavelength]]s are much longer than optical [[wavelength]]s

## Infrared/Ultraviolet Telescopes

- Infrared or [[ultraviolet rays]]
- Very similar to optical telescopes in design
- Very little radiation of these types make it to the ground
