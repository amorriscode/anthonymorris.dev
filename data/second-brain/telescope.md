# Telescope

- Bigger is better
  - Bad for glass refractors
    - Hard to make
    - Weight causes sagging
    - Air bubbles distort
    - Opaque at some wavelengths
  - Largest visible-light telescopes today have 8 to 10 meter mirrors
- On ground
  - Stable, controlled
  - Bigger dishes
  - Atmospheric blurring
- In space
  - No atmosphere
  - Expensive
  - Difficult to maintain

## Reflecting Telescopes

![Types of reflecting telescopes](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-13-14-21-50.png)

- Usually have two mirrors
  - Primary
  - Secondary
- Configurations
  - Newtonian
  - Cassegrain
  - Nasmyth/Coud√©
    - Commonly used as professional telescopes

## Radio Telescopes

- [[Radio waves]]
- Observe at any time of the day
- Wire meshes or dishes

## Infrared/Ultraviolet Telescopes

- Infrared or [[ultraviolet rays]]
- Very similar to optical telescopes in design
- Very little radiation of these types make it to the ground
