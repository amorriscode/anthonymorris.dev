# Telescope

- [[Lens]]es and [[mirror]]s allow us to make telescopes
  - Focus [[light]]
  - Reflect and refract [[light]]
- Bigger is better
  - Bigger --> more [[light]] you can collect, better resolution
  - Bad for glass refractors
    - Hard to make
    - Weight causes sagging
    - Air bubbles distort
    - Opaque at some [[wavelength]]s
  - Largest visible-[[light]] telescopes today have 8 to 10 meter [[mirror]]s

## Types

- [[Refracting telescope]]s
- [[Reflecting telescope]]s
- [[Radio telescope]]s
- [[Infrared telescope]]s
- [[Ultraviolet telescope]]s
- [[X-ray telescope]]s
- [[Gamma ray telescope]]s

## Location of Telescopes

- On ground
  - Stable, controlled
  - Bigger dishes
  - Atmospheric blurring
- In space
  - No [[atmosphere]] to cause blurring
  - Expensive
  - Difficult to maintain
