# Refracting Telescope

![A refracting telescope](../../public/assets/second-brain/2021-02-02-19-16-01.png)

- First type of telescopes built
- [[Lens]]es instead of [[mirror]]s
- Use a glass objective [[lens]] to gather and focus [[light]]
  - [[Light]] passes through the lens and splits into [[wavelength]]s

## Advantages

- Rugged
- Rarely needs cleaning (glass is sealed inside)
- Tube is closed off from outside air so air/temperature has less impact

## Disadvantages

- [[Chromatic aberration]]
  - Colour deviation or distortion
  - When all the [[wavelength]]s are not capable of meeting at the same [[focal point]]
