# Big Data

- Large data sets
- Defy conventional management solutions such as spreadsheets and [[database]]s

## Challenges

- Large data sets often contain different kinds of data
  - Not just basic numeric data, text, and images
  - Multimedia (audio, video, etc.)
- Storing large amounts of data requires massive amounts of secondary [[computer memory]]
- Selecting and organizing data for analysis requires significant processing power
- Protecting big data requires technological and logistical planning
