# Turing Machine

- General purpose [[computer]]
- Invented by [[Alan Turing]]
- Used to study the limits of what can be computed
- Components
  - A [[control unit]]
    - Simulates a person
  - Read/write head that can read and write symbols on an infinite tape
    - Tape is divided into cells
- Finite instructions
  - Read from a cell on the tape
  - Write to a cell on the tape
  - Move the tape one cell left
  - Move the tape one cell right

## Halting Problem

- Unsolvable problem of determining whether any program will eventually stop given a particular input
