# IPv6

- 128 bits
- Written as eight blocks of hexadecimal numbers
  - Last four blocks identify the interface
  - First four blocks identify the network
    - Serve as the network prefix
      - Also called site prefix or global routing prefix
  - Fourth block in the site prefix can be altered to create subnets

## Subnets

- [[Subnetting]] is simpler than IPv4
  - Classes not used
  - Subnet masks are not used
- [[Subnetting]] helps admins manage the enormous volume of IPv6 addresses
