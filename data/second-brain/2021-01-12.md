- There are objective and subjective worlds
  - My subjective will is true if the objects in it correspond to objects in the objective world
    - The subjective properties of that thing must correspond to its actual properties
- Both objective and subjective worlds contain *propositions*
- Propositions are:
   1. The meaning of a declarative sentence
   2. The content of a belief
   3. The primary bearer of truth and falsehood
   4. Subject matter of logic
- Propositions are language independent
