# Universal Law of Gravitation

- Every [[particle]] attracts every other [[particle]] with a [[force]] proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
- Gravitational attraction between two objects
- [[Inverse square law]]

## Formula

- $F_{gravity} = G \frac{M_1M_2}{R^2}$
  - $F_{gravity}$ is the force of gravity between two objects
  - $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of two objects
  - $R$ is the separation of those objects
  - $G$ is the _universal gravitational constant_
