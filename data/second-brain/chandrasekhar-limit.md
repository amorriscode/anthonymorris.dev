# Chandrasekhar Limit

- Named after [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]
- The maximum [[mass]] a [[star]] can end its life with and still become a [[white dwarf]]
  - Even degenerate [[electron]]s cannot stop the collapse of a star with more mass than ~1.4 $M_{Sun}$
- All [[star]]s that have masses below the Chandrasekhar limit when they run out of [[energy]] will become [[white dwarf]]s
  - The [[mass]] they were born with does not matter
