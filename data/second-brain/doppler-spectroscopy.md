# Doppler Spectroscopy (Radial Velocity Method)

- Indirect method for finding [[exoplanet]]s
- Measure [[radial velocity]] via observation of Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the [[planet]]'s parent [[star]]
  - If a [[planet]] exists, the [[gravity]] of the [[planet]] causes the [[star]] to wobble
- If a [[planet]] is detected, a minimum [[mass]] for the [[planet]] can be determined from the changes in the [[star]]'s [[radial velocity]]
  - More precise measurements require the inclination of the [[planet]]'s [[orbit]]
- Can tell us the orbital period of the [[planet]]
- Most sensitive to large [[planet]]s [[orbit]]ing close to the [[star]]

## Procedure

![Radial Velocity Measurements using Doppler Spectroscopy](/assets/second-brain/2020-12-01-13-15-49.png)

- Series of observations of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] emitted by a [[star]]
- Periodic variations in the [[star]]'s spectrum may be detected
  - Wavelength of characteristic spectral lines increasing and decreasing over time
- [[Astronomer]]s use [[math]] to isolate a [[sine wave]] that indicates a [[planet]] in [[orbit]]
