- Two types of [[knowledge]]
  - Relations of ideas
    - A proposition expresses a relation of ideas if its denial is impossible (self-contradictory)
      - Have to be true
      - Necessary truths
    - Verified through deductive reasoning
    - E.g. All bachelors are male, geometry, algebra
  - Matters of fact
    - A proposition expresses a matter of fact if both it and its denial are possible (not self-contradictory)
    - Verified through experience
    - E.g. The [[Sun]] will rise tomorrow
