[[phil-1101]]

- Two types of [[knowledge]]
  - Relations of ideas
    - A proposition expresses a relation of ideas if its denial is impossible (self-contradictory)
    - E.g. All bachelors are male
  - Matters of fact
    - A proposition expresses a matter of fact if both it and its denial are possible (not self-contradictory)
    - E.g. The [[Sun]] will rise tomorrow
