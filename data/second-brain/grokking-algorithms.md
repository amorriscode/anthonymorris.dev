# Grokking Algorithms

- Teaches widely applicable [[algorithm]]s

## Chapter 3 - Recursion

- [[Recursion]]
- Easy to write functions that end up in infinite loops
  - We must account for the *base case* to stop the infinite loops from happening
- Using recursion, and therefore the [[call stack]], takes up a lot of [[computer memory]]
