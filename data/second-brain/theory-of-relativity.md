# Theory of Relativity

- Your description of physical [[reality]] is the same regardless of the constant [[velocity]] at which you move
- Regardless of your speed or direction, you always measure the speed of [[light]] to be the same
  - The only thing that is *not* relative is the speed of [[light]]
