# Comet

- Small bodies
- Rocks with ice either at the surface or beneath the surface
  - Made of frozen gases such as [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[carbon monoxide]]
- Remnants from the formation of [[the Solar System]]
- At 20 AU the tails and coma start becoming visible
- Irregular shapes
  - Not enough [[mass]] to become spherical
- Don't last forever
  - Lose mass
  - Break up

## Coma

- Visible coma
  - Fuzzy atmosphere around comet
  - Halo of gas, ice, and rock
  - Effects of solar radiation upon the comet's [[nucleus]]
- Nuclei are loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles a few km in size
- Dust tail and ion tail
