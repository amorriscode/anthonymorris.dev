# Comparative Planetology

- Comparing/contrasting [[planet]]s
- Goal is to understand how they are different, why they are different, and what we can learn from the differences

## Terrestrial Planets

- Surfaces probably started out the same
  - Rocky material
  - Heavily bombarded
- What changed?
  - Weather?
  - Geological activity?
- Inside
  - Measured with seismic waves
  - Layers
    - Core
    - Mantle
    - Crust
  - [[Magnetic field]]s
    - Information about the inside
    - Requirements
      - Electrically conducting fluid
      - [[Convection]] in that layer
      - Moderately rapid rotation

### Why they are different

- Size
  - Bigger planets star warmer longer
  - Leaders to more volcanism
  - Outgassing
  - [[Magnetic field]]
- Distance from the [[Sun]]
  - Rain, snow, ice oceans
    - Create erosion
  - Escape velocities
    - Atmospheric layers can escape the [[gravity]]
- Rate of rotation
  - Drives wind and weather
  - [[Magnetic field]]
