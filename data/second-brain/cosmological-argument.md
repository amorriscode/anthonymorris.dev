# Cosmological Arguments

- Attempt to infer existence of [[God]] from observations about causation, change, motion, or related phenomena
  - Where did the Universe come from? What caused all of this?

## Using the Principle of Sufficient Reason

- [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s approach
- Basic structure:
   1. Everything contingent fact has an explanation ([[Principle of Sufficient Reason]])
   2. There is a contingent fact $C$ that includes all other contingent facts
   3. Facts cannot explain themselves
   4. Therefore: there must be a necessary being
