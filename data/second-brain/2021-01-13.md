[[phil-2203]]

- Fundamentals of [[Metaphysics]]
- Our beliefs are kind of like maps and the World is the territory of the map
  - Realist view: we can know about the World that exists external to us ([[realism]])
- Anachronistic
  - [[Anachronism]]
- Basic components of the World
  - Particulars
    - Things you can interact with
  - Cause and effect
  - Properties and relations
    - Relations could be seen as properties of pairs, triples, etc.
    - Provide structure to [[reality]]
    - What [[Plato]] called the Form
  - Propositions
  - Possible states of affairs
    - Including facts
- Propositions vs. properties
  - Related
  - Both conceptual, or intelligible, components of [[reality]]
  - Can one be derived from the other?
- Propositions use internal objects
  - Meanings are components of one's subjective world
    - [[Epistemic state]]
  - Relating this to maps...
    - Towns on a map are *not* the actual towns in the world
  - So, propositions appear to exist mostly in the [[mind]]

| Mind                             | World                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Subjective                       | Objective                      |
| Map                              | Territory                      |
| Proposition (statement, thought) | Possible state of affairs      |
| True proposition                 | Fact (actual state of affairs) |
| Internal object (idea)           | External object                |
| Concepts                         | Properties                     |
| Epistemic probability            | Objective chance               |

- [[Realism]] vs. [[anti-Realism]]
- Natural kinds
  - Some [[human]] concepts that are more "real" than others
  - Capture real divisions of [[reality]] better
- So, what is truly objective?
  - To a [[realist]]
    - The actual world
    - The "totality of facts"
- Dividing the actual world into bite size facts may be a [[human]] construct
  - Even if so, the World determines whether or not a given proposition is true or false
- [[Psychologism]]
  - Laws of logic
- Are propositions psychological?
  - If they were, they could change over time

- What is [[existence]]?
- What turns a state of affairs into a fact?
  - Facts seem to have an extra ingredient of *real* [[existence]]
    - Concreteness
    - A concrete object is one that can be causes and effects
      - Contrasted with abstract objects that are non-causal (accessible only to the mind)
  - Is this extra ingredient a *property*?
