# Circuit

- A bunch of [[logic gates]] combined
  - Output of one gate --> input of another
  - Flow of electricity is controlled by the interacting gates
- **Equivalent** when they produce the *same output for identical input*

## Combinational Circuits

- Circuit whose output is solely determined by its input values

## Sequential Circuits

- Circuit whose output is a function of its input values and _the current state_ of the circuit

## Adders

- Performs addition operation on binary values

### Half Adder

- Computes the sum of two bits and produces the appropriate carry bit
- An `XOR` and an `AND` gate
- Doesn't allow a possible carry coming in the calculation

### Full Adder

- Computes the sum of two bits, taking an input carry bit into account

## Multiplexers

- Input control signals determine which input is routed to its output
  - Many input lines
- Often called a _mux_
- Values on $n$ input control lines determine which of $2^n$ other data lines are selected for output
- Demultiplexer (_demux_) is the opposite of a _mux_
  - Single input --> one of $2^n$ outputs depending on values of $n$ control lines

## Circuits as Memory

- Can store information
- Sequential circuit
  - Output serves as input
  - Existing state of circuit is used to determine next state

### S-R Latch

- Stores single bit
- Guarantees two outputs ($X$ and $Y$) are always complements of each other

## Integrated Circuits

- A _chip_
- Piece of [[silicon]] on which multiple [[logic gates]] have been embedded
- Classified by the number of [[logic gates]] contained in them
