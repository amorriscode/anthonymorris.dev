# Circuit

- Circuits are said to be equivalent when they produce the same output for identical input

## Combinational Circuits

- Circuit whose output is solely determined by its input values
- [[Logic gates]] can be combined into circuits
  - Output of one gate --> input of another

## Sequential Circuits

- Circuit whose output is a function of its input values and _the current state_ of the circuit
