# Plate Tectonics

- Distinct boundaries of the [[Earth]]'s crust
- Explains how slow motions within [[Earth]]'s mantle move large segments of the crust
- Results in a gradual drifting of the continents
- Forms mountains and other large-scale geological features
- Cooling system for the planet
  - Heat from inside --> outside
- There are ~12 tectonic plates on [[Earth]]
- Plates are moved by [[convection]] of the mantle
- Four basic interactions between plates at their boundaries
  - Pull apart
  - One plate burrows under another
  - Slide alongside each other
  - Jam together
- Constantly renews [[Earth]]'s crust and erases cratering events

## Rift and Subduction Zones

- **Rift zones**
  - Plates pull apart from each other
  - Most found in the oceans
- **Subduction zones**
  - Two plates come together, one is forced beneath another
  - Thinner oceanic plates can be readily thrust down into upper mantle
  - Often marked by ocean trenches

## Fault Zones

- Crustal plates sliding parallel to each other
- Marked by cracks or faults
- Motion builds up stresses in the crust and released in sudden, violent slippages
  - This generates [[earthquake]]s
  - The longer the interval between [[earthquake]]s, the greater the stress and more energy released when the surface finally moves
