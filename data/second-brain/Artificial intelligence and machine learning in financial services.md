# Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in financial services
- [Artificial intelligence and machine learning in financial services](https://www.fsb.org/2017/11/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-financial-service/)

## Background and definitions
- Categories of machine learning
	- Supervised learning
		- Contains labels
		- Algorithm predicts labels for observations without labels
	- Unsupervised learning
		- Data has no labels
		- Algorithm predicts patterns based on underlying characteristics
	- Reinforcement learning
		- Falls between supervised and unsupervised
		- Algorithm is fed unlabelled set of data --> chooses an action for each data point --> gets feedback based on the action
	- Deep learning
		- Utilizes neural networks
- Machine learning algorithms are used to identify patterns
	- The patterns are correlation

## Drivers
- Faster processor speeds
- Lower hardware costs
- Access to computing power via the cloud
- Storage is cheap for large amounts of data
- The financial sector benefits from AI/ML growth in other areas
	- Search engines, self-driving cars, etc.

## Selected use cases
- Examples:
	- Sentiment analysis
	- Trading signals
	- Fraud detection

### Customer-focused use cases

#### Credit scoring
- Speed up lending decisions
- Sources for unstructured data used to create a credit score:
	- Social media
	- Mobile phone use
	- Test messages
- Goals:
	- Lowering the cost of assessing credit risks
	- Increase the number of people whose credit risk is being assessed
- Problems
	- False negatives can be very harmful for people
	- Black box decision making may not be fair
		- Biases built into the AI models?

#### Insurance
- Using data like online shopping or sensors in your car
	- I'm actually pro-car telemetrics for insurance; drive irresponsibly --> pay more insurance
		- What about speeding to the hospital because your wife is pregnant?
		- Hard to deal with edge cases
- Used to make it easier for humans to process claims
	- Highlight key considerations

#### Chatbots
- Serve more customers with automated responses

### Operations-focused

#### Capital optimisation
- Maximization of profits given scarce capital
- Relies heavily on math

#### Market Impact Analysis
- Evaluating the effect of a firm's trading on market prices
- Attempt to minimize trading execution costs

### Trading and portfolio management
- Execution --> sell-side
- Portfolio management --> buy-side

#### Trading execution
- Using data to improve ability to sell
	- Eg. using past trading behaviour to predict a client's next order
- Taking advantage of the massive amounts of data trading creates
- Used to pro-actively manage risk exposure
	- Eg. flag an account if it's risk profile has increased

#### Portfolio management
- Identify new signals on price movements
- Mostly used by quant funds
- Drives a small amount of quant funds' trades due to lack of trust
	- They want insights on the decisions made by models

## Micro-financial analysis

### Impact on markets
- Enabling certain participants to collect and analyze data on a bigger scale
	- Help to build understanding on the relationship between market prices and various factors
- Lower participants trading costs

### Impact on financial institutions
- Enhancing operations
	- Increasing revenue, decreasing costs
- Better risk management
	- May miss new types of fraud due to lack of historical data
- Reducing fraud
- Increase collaboration between financial institutions and other industries
	- Other industries are driving AI/machine learning
- New set of issues due to black box decision-making
	- Hard for humans to grasp AI decisions
	- Who is responsible for bad decisions?
- Increased dependance on third-parties
	- Developers of the technology

### Impact on consumers and investors
- Lower fees and borrowing costs
- Wider access to financial services
	- Could also be the opposite if a machine learning model determines you aren't fit for particular services
- More personalized services

## Macro-financial analysis
- More efficient risk management for individual loans may benefit the larger system
- New economies of scope (collaboration between industries) could help economic growth
- Economy-wide investment in AI/machine learning could stimulate economic growth

### Market concentration
- Those who own the data benefit the most
- Those who develop the technology benefit the most
- Those who can afford the technology benefit the most
	- Big banks might edge out smaller firms simply due to their ability to pay for better tech
	- This is probably already the case?
