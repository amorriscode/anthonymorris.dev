# Wave

- Repeating phenomenon
  - Cyclical
  - Series of crests and troughs

## Characteristics

![Characterizing waves](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-05-13-14-58.png)

- Crests (peaks)
- Troughs (valleys)
- [[Wavelength]]
- [[Frequency]]

## Speed

- $c = \lamba f$
  - $c$ is the speed
  - $\lamba$ is the [[wavelength]]
  - $f$ is the [[frequency]]
