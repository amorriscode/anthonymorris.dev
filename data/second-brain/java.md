# Java

- Developed by Sun Micro-Systems
- First [[programming language]] that wasn't tied to an [[operating system]] or [[hardware]]
- General purpose [[programming language]]

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- Programs are compiled into [[Bytecode]]
- The [[Java Virtual Machine]] is an [[interpreter]] that executes [[Bytecode]]

## Programs

- Every [[program]] must have at least one class
  - All other code is inside that class
- Program always begins executing at the `main` method
  - `main` must always be defined in the same way
