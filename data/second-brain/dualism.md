# Dualism

- Something about us is over and above the purely material, physical stuff
- Argument for dualism
  - Can thought, feelings, experience, reason, etc. be fully explained in purely physical terms?

## Substance Dualism

- View that [[mind]]s and [[brain]]s are different kinds of things
- Allows for a [[mind]] to exist after the [[brain]] dies off
  - They are independently existing things
- Split into two categories:
  - **Popular Dualism**
    - The [[mind]] is like a ghost that resides within the [[body]]
  - **Cartesian Dualism**
    - The [[mind]] is a non-physical substance that doesn't exist in space

## Property Dualism

- View that there's only one kind of thing but two kinds of properties
- The [[mind]] cannot exist after the [[brain]] dies off
  - They are not independently existing things
