## Study Questions / Issues to Prepare
1.  How do new forms of AI enabled data analytics, pattern recognition, chatbots, natural language processing, and robotic process automation fit within other emerging FinTech trends?
	- Our ability to store and process data
2.  How has it affected the competitive landscape of financial incumbents, big tech firms, and FinTech startups?
3.  What new public policy challenges are AI and machine learning presenting for the fairness, explainability, privacy, robustness, and resiliency of the financial sector? How do and should these new applications and tools fit within the regulatory structure of the financial industry?
	- Need to ensure certain biases (race, gender, etc.) in models don't exist
			- Black box reasoning isn't acceptable
