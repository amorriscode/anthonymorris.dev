# Encryption

- Use of mathematical code (**cipher**) to scramble data into a format that can be read only by reversing the cipher
- Keeps information private
- Benchmarks / CIA triad
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability

## Key Encryption

- Key
  - Randoms string of characters
  - Woven into original data's bits
  - Generates unique data block called **ciphertext**
  - Created according to specific algorithm

### Private Key Encryption

- Data encrypted with a single key
  - Sender and receiver have the same key
- Symmetric encryption
  - Same key is used for encryption and decryption

### Public Key Encryption

- Data encrypted with two keys
- Private key --> know by user
- Public key --> know by anyone
- Asymmetric encryption
  - Requires two different keys
