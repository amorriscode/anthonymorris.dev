- A person's belief is justified if it was produced through a reliable belief forming mechanism
  - One knows that $P$ if and only if $P$ is true, one believes that $P$ is true, and one has arrived at the belief that $P$ through some *reliable process*
- Process reliabilism has been used as an argument against [[philosophical skepticism]]
