# Straw Man

- Distorting, weakening, or oversimplifying someone's position so it can be more easily attacked or refuted
- Often includes poor paraphrasing, taking a quote out of context
- Covertly replaces the original proposition with a different, weak one that is easily defeated

## Examples

### Self-driving Cars

- [[Elon Musk]]
  - Self-driving cars are a natural extension of active safety
  - Something we should do
- Reporter
  - Self-driving cars aren't safe
  - Points to self-driving accident
- Elon never stated self-driving cars are 100% safe
  - Accident is taken out of context

### Evolution

- Scientist
  - Explains how animals developed and diversified over millions of years
- Opponent
  - Questions why monkeys still exist if we evolved from them
  - Why don't we have three arms or other things to give us competitive advantage?
- Opponent is misunderstanding the theory
  - Poor use of the theory
  - Evolution does not say we evolved from monkeys (just have a common ancestor)
