# Shift Nudge - Typography
- The most critical part to interface design

## Font Size
- Sloppy and inconsistent use of size, weight, and colours --> telltale sign someone doesn't know what they are doing

### Rule of 4
- Try to limit yourself to a *maximum* of four type sizes
- To add variety/emphasis use:
	- ALL CAPS
	- **Bold text**
	- Regular text
	- _Emphasized text_
- Common types of text
	- Titles
	- Subtitles
	- Actions
	- Metadata
