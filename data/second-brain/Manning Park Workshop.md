## The Mechanics of a Great Image
- 99% of wildlife phots fail, it's important to know where the 1% is
- Two of the biggest mistakes in wildlife:
	- Getting to a place too late
	- Leaving a place too early

### Lighting
- Dictates...
	- your subject
	- how you approach your subject
	- your gear
	- your settings
	- your composition
- Be very observant in the field
	- Catchlights
	- Iridescence
	- Light interacting with the subjects form
	- How changing light will change your opportunities

#### Sun
- Warm, dramatic
- Front lit photos can look flat because everything is lit evenly
	- Lack of shadows, lack of depth
- Always consider your position relative to the sun

#### Overcast
- Decreases contrasts and smooths gradations
- Can lack some punch/depth

#### Twilight/Indirect
- Moody
- Results in images when most others may have packed up or haven't arrived yet
- For wildlife, best reserved for still subjects
