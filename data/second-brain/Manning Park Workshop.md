# Manning Park Photo Workshop
- July 18 --> July 21, 2023
- Location: [[Manning Park]]

Locations:
- Boundary Bay

## The Mechanics of a Great Image
- 99% of wildlife phots fail, it's important to know where the 1% is
- Two of the biggest mistakes in wildlife:
	- Getting to a place too late
	- Leaving a place too early

### Lighting
- Dictates...
	- your subject
	- how you approach your subject
	- your gear
	- your settings
	- your composition
- Be very observant in the field
	- Catchlights
	- Iridescence
	- Light interacting with the subjects form
	- How changing light will change your opportunities

#### Sun
- Warm, dramatic
- Front lit photos can look flat because everything is lit evenly
	- Lack of shadows, lack of depth
- Always consider your position relative to the sun

#### Overcast
- Decreases contrasts and smooths gradations
- Can lack some punch/depth

#### Twilight/Indirect
- Moody
- Results in images when most others may have packed up or haven't arrived yet
- For wildlife, best reserved for still subjects

## Prioritizing Settings
- There is no "perfect" exposure
	- ie: perfect combo of ISO/shutter speed/aperture
	- Can use a variety of settings
- All lenses have a sweet spot for aperture *lookup image*
	- [[Diffraction]]
		- Less at large apertures
		- More at small apertures
	- [[Aberration]]
		- More at large apertures
		- Less at small apertures
- Wider lenses show less motion blur
- Increasing light sensitivity (ISO) has negative impacts to file quality
	- Higher levels of noise
	- Lower levels of fine detail
	- Decreased dynamic range
	- Worse colour representation

## Ingredients of a Captivating Portfolio
- Qualities
	- Nice light
	- Engaging subject
	- Interesting subject
	- Strong compositions
	- Pleasing backgrounds
	- Clean post-processing
- A single photo can getaway with missing some of these things but as a whole, it makes a portfolio less impactful
