## `ping`

- Packet Internet Groper
- Used to verify that TCP/IP is:
  - Installed
  - Bound to NIC
  - Configured correctly
  - Communicating with the network
- Sends out a signal called an echo request to another device
  - Other device responds with an echo reply
- ICMP
  - Internet Control Message Protocol
  - Protocol used by echo request/reply
  - Carries error messages and info about the network
- For IPv6
  - `ping6` on Linux
  - `ping -6` on Windows

## `ipconfig` (Windows)

- Shows current TCP/IP addressing and domain name info
- `ipconfig /all` shows complete summary

## `ifconfig` (Linux)

- Utility to view/manage TCP/IP settings

## `nslookup`

- Name space lookup
- Allows you to query [[DNS]] database from any computer on a network
  - Used to find host name of a device by specifying its [[IP address]] (or vice versa)
  - Useful for verifying a host is configured correctly
  - Useful for troubleshooting [[DNS]] resolution problems
- Reverse [[DNS]] lookup
  - Find host name of device whose IP address you know

## `dig` (Linux)

- Domain Information Groper
- Provides more detailed information than [`nslookup`](#nslookup)
- Uses more reliable sources of info to output its results
