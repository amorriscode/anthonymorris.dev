# Neutrino

- Fundamental [[particle]] that has:
  - No charge
  - Mass that is tiny relative to an [[electron]]
- Interact very weakly with other [[matter]]
- Difficult to detect

## Solar Neutrino Problem

- Discrepancy between solar neutrinos measured and the predicted amount
  - Predicted from the [[Sun]]'s luminosity
  - Much lower measured than predicted
- Neutrinos from the [[Sun]] have mixed quantum states so our detectors couldn't always detect them
  - We were looking for electron neutrinos
  - The neutrinos from the [[Sun]] could propagate into a mixture of electron, muon, and tau neutrinos
    - Neutrino oscillation
