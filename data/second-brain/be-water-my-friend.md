=# Be Water, My Friend

*Empty your [[mind]].*
*Be formless, shapeless, like [[water]].*
*You put [[water]] into a cup; it becomes the cup.*
*You put [[water]] into a teapot; it becomes the teapot.*
*You put it into a bottle; it becomes the bottle.*
*Now [[water]] can flow, or it can crash!*
*Be [[water]], my friend.*

- Written by [[Shannon Lee]]

## Chapter 1 - The Water Way

- I've selected a few of [[water]]'s attributes that stuck out to me
  - The few that I didn't include were *no limitation*, *have appropriate tension*
- [[Shannon Lee]] brings up [[astrology]] in this chapter which seemed random and out of place but it made me laugh

### Be Aware

- [[Awareness]] is about living consciously, purposefully, and intentionally
- Don't let life happen *to* you
  - Be fully involved in the creation of your life
- Choose to respond, not react
  - Pure emotional reactions often come from a mind polluted with negativity
  - You can't choose a response if you can't even see there are choices to be made
  
### Be Pliable

> When man is living, he is soft and pliable; when he is dead, he becomes rigid. Pliability is life; rigidity is [[death]], whether we are speaking of the body, the [[mind]], or the [[spirit]]. Be pliable.

- Remember the bamboo and the oak tree in a storm
  - The rigidity of the oak tree causes it to crack and fall over
  - The bamboo bends and thrives
- [[Awareness]] allows us to see our options so that you can respond flexibly
- Life is constantly changing and in flux, you should flow with it

## Be Purposeful

- *What* you do and *who* you are are not as important as *how* you express the what and who
- What do you embody?
- The pursuit of *self-actualization*
  - Make reality of who we want to be, the life we want to life, etc.
  - Know oneself and express the uniqueness of oneself in the world with skill and ease
- Always engage in the process of discovering and embodying our most real and true selves

## Be Whole

- Yin and yang
  - Without hot, there is no cold, without sadness, there is no happiness, etc.
- The is a [[duality]] within the world, embrace it
  - Seek the whole experience that is life

## Chapter 2 - The Empty Cup

- If we close ourselves to the world, we cannot learn the lessons in front of us
- Approach every experience with a willingness to discover something new
- What is the world like with no expectations?
- Our judgements often create the positive/negative aspects of the world so what happens if we leave [[judgement]] at the door?

> I must give up my desire to force, direct, strangle the world outside of me and within me in order to be completely open, responsible, aware, alive. This is often called "to make oneself empty," which does not mean something negative, but means the openness to receive.

- In order to empty our cups we need to master [[awareness]]
  - The ability to notice our thoughts and let them go
- +1 for [[meditation]]

## Chapter 3 - The Eternal Student

- [[Zen Beginner's Mind]]
- Similar to closing ourselves off the the world, we close ourselves off to [[knowledge]] when we think we have all the answers
- We have to find [[knowledge]] for ourselves
  - A good teacher simply points to [[truth]] but does not give it
- If your decisions are being guided by **should** then they may be misguided
  - [[Ego]] vs true [[self]]
- Weaknesses and strengths are connected
  - Duality
  - Life is about balance
- [[Self-help]] is about [[ownership]] of our lives
  - The only help is the help we give to ourselves
  - We must work on ourselves every day
