# Be Water, My Friend

*Empty your [[mind]].*
*Be formless, shapeless, like [[water]].*
*You put [[water]] into a cup; it becomes the cup.*
*You put [[water]] into a teapot; it becomes the teapot.*
*You put it into a bottle; it becomes the bottle.*
*Now [[water]] can flow, or it can crash!*
*Be [[water]], my friend.*

- Written by [[Shannon Lee]]

## The Water Way (Chapter 1)

- I've selected a few of [[water]]'s attributes that stuck out to me
  - The few that I didn't include were *no limitation*, *have appropriate tension*
- [[Shannon Lee]] brings up [[astrology]] in this chapter which seemed random and out of place but it made me laugh

### Be Aware

- [[Awareness]] is about living consciously, purposefully, and intentionally
- Don't let life happen *to* you
  - Be fully involved in the creation of your life
- Choose to respond, not react
  - Pure emotional reactions often come from a mind polluted with negativity
  - You can't choose a response if you can't even see there are choices to be made
  
### Be Pliable

> When man is living, he is soft and pliable; when he is dead, he becomes rigid. Pliability is life; rigidity is [[death]], whether we are speaking of the body, the [[mind]], or the [[spirit]]. Be pliable.

- Remember the bamboo and the oak tree in a storm
  - The rigidity of the oak tree causes it to crack and fall over
  - The bamboo bends and thrives
- [[Awareness]] allows us to see our options so that you can respond flexibly
- Life is constantly changing and in flux, you should flow with it

## Be Purposeful

- *What* you do and *who* you are are not as important as *how* you express the what and who
- What do you embody?
- The pursuit of *self-actualization*
  - Make reality of who we want to be, the life we want to life, etc.
  - Know oneself and express the uniqueness of oneself in the world with skill and ease
- Always engage in the process of discovering and embodying our most real and true selves

## Be Whole

- Yin and yang
  - Without hot, there is no cold, without sadness, there is no happiness, etc.
- The is a [[duality]] within the world, embrace it
  - Seek the whole experience that is life
