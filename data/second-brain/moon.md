# Moon

- 384,000 kilometers from the [[Earth]]
- Diameter is 3476 kilometers
  - About $1/4$ the size of the [[Earth]]
- Moves about 12Ëš in the sky each day
  - ~24 times its diameter
- Rotates on its axis at the same time it revolves around [[Earth]]
  - This is why we only see one side of it
  - Synchronous rotation
  - Tidally-locked rotation
- Far side of the Moon more heavily cratered
  - Easier to hit because the other side is always facing [[Earth]]
- Regolith on the surface of the Moon
  - Layer of fine powder and rock fragments
- $\frac{1}{80}$ the mass of [[Earth]]
- $\frac{1}{6}$ the gravity of [[Earth]]
  - Too low to retain an atmosphere
- Made mostly of silicate rock

## Moonths

- Takes one month (moonth) to revolve around the [[Earth]]
- Synodic month / solar month
  - 29.5306
- Sidereal month
  - 27.3217 days

## Phases

![Phases of the Moon](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-27-07-17-00.png)

- Full cycle every solar month
- New moon --> in front of the [[Sun]] (dark)
- Full moon --> opposite the [[Sun]]

## Origin

- The fission theory
  - Moon was once part of [[Earth]]
  - Somehow separated in early history
- The sister theory
  - Moon formed together with (but independent of) [[Earth]]
  - Similar to moons of out [[planet]]s
- The capture theory
  - Moon formed elsewhere in [[the Solar System]]
  - Captured by [[Earth]]
- The giant impact hypothesis
  - Most likely
  - [[Earth]] was struck with a massive object
  - The impact ejected a vast amount of material into space
    - Ejected material cooled and formed the Moon
