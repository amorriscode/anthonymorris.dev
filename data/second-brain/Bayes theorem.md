# Bayes' theorem
- Helps you figure out the likelihood of something existing by using evidence to update your guess on the likelihood
- Core tool for [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]]

## Formula
$P(A∣B)=\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)​}$
	- $|$ means "given that"
- $P(A|B)$
	- Probability of event A occurring given that B is true
	- Posterior probability
- $P(B|A)$
	- Probability of event B occurring given that A is true
- $P(A)$
	- Probability of event A occurring on its own
	- Prior probability -- what you believed before considering new evidence (B)
- $P(B)$
	- Probability of event B occurring on its own
