- Chapter 23.1 - The Death of Low-Mass [[Star]]s
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe the physical characteristics of degenerate [[matter]] and explain how the [[mass]] and radius of [[degenerate star]]s are related
    - Plot the future evolution of a [[white dwarf]] and show how its observable features will change over time
    - Distinguish which [[star]]s will become [[white dwarf]]s
  - The number of [[star]]s decreases as [[mass]] increases
    - Really massive [[star]]s are rare
- Chapter 23.2 - Evolution of Massive [[Star]]s: An Explosive Finish
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe the interior of a massive [[star]] before a [[supernova]]
    - Explain the steps of a core collapse and explosion
    - List the hazards associated with nearby supernovae
- Chapter 23.3 - [[Supernova]] Observations
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe the observed features of SN 1987A both before and after the [[supernova]]
    - Explain how observations of various parts of the SN 1987A event helped confirm theories about supernovae
- Chapter 23.4 - [[Pulsar]]s and the Discovery of [[Neutron Star]]s
  - Learning Objectives
    - Explain the research method that led to the discovery of [[neutron star]]s, located hundreds or thousands of [[light-year]]s away
    - Describe the features of a [[neutron star]] that allow it to be detected as a [[pulsar]]
    - List the observational evidence that links [[pulsar]]s and [[neutron star]]s to supernovae
- Chapter 23.5 - The Evolution of [[Binary Star]] Systems
  - Learning Objectives
    - Describe the kind of [[binary star]] system that leads to a nova event
    - Describe the type of [[binary star]] system that leads to a type Ia supernovae event
    - Indicate how type Ia supernovae differ from type II supernovae
