# How Forests Store Carbon
-   [[Carbon dioxide]] goes up, threat of [[climate change]] goes up
-   Carbon capture tech...
    -   Unproven
    -   Expensive
    -   Mostly theoretical
-   Trees and forests —> the best carton capture tech
    -   Sequester ~16% of the [[United States]] annual emissions
    -   Store carbon in trees and soil
-   Trees
    -   The best carbon capture tech in the world (yay Wren!)
    -   Pull [[carbon dioxide]] out of the air during photosynthesis
        -   Pull it out of the air, bind it up in sugar, and release oxygen
-   Forests are good at storing carbon for a long time
    -   It does ultimately get released via decomposition, respiration, and other methods
    -   Permanence is the ability to store carbon for long periods
        -   It varies based on location
-   The [[Amazon rainforest]] is a poor carbon sink because there is little permanence
    -   Whole trees rapidly decompose, the soils are not able to store a lot of carbon
-   Enhancing carbon capture
    -   Increasing forest cover (best way)
    -   Controlling invasive plant species
        -   Disrupting natural ecosystems interferes with a forest’s ability to sequester carbon
    -   Periodically thin forests to encourage growth of new trees
        -   Must reduce disturbance to soil
