## Computational complexity
- How runtime grow as the function grows?
- Expressed with [[big o]] notation (worst case)
- Simple steps to determine [[Big O]] of an equation
	- Find the fastest growing term
	- Take out the coefficient
- Time complexity --> time algorithm requires
- Space complexity --> amount of memory algorithm requires
