# Todo

- [ ] Put together RedwoodJS talk for React Vancouver
  - Suggestions from @thedavidprice
    For React peeps, I'd focus on how Redwood conventions make things easier, especially concepts like Cells. If you haven't spent much time with the built-in Test suite or Storybook integration, those would :exploding_head: (especially the Storybook mocking for Cells). Other ideas:
    1. Just diagram overall architecture. Here's a good image: https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/the-redwood-architecture-diagram-from-toms-talk/9841
    2. Show how easy it is to work with an API using Redwood
    3. Probably give a high-level on designed for "edge-ready" deployment. E.g. API as functions on AWS Lambda and Web as static assets on CDN. Buzzword = full-stack Jamstack
