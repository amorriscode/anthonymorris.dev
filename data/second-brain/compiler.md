[[Computer Science]] [[Compiled Programming Language]]

# Compiler

![Compilation process](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-28-15-01-22.png)

- Program that translates a high-level [[programming language]] into [[machine language]]
	- Reads files in one language and outputs files in another language
- Compilers _don't_ execute the output, a user must run the program

## Self-hosting
- A compiler written in the same language it compiles
- Must be bootstrapped first
	- eg. write a compiler in a different language, compile the first self-hosting compiler, get rid of the original one
