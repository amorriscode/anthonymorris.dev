# Wireless Networking

![The wireless spectrum](/assets/second-brain/2020-10-17-14-52-20.png)

- Most wireless devices implement one of two technologies:
  - FHSS (frequency hopping spread spectrum)
    - Frequency hopping
      - Short bursts of data are transmitted on particular frequency within the band
      - Next burst goes to next frequency in a sequence
    - Cheaper to implement than DSSS
    - More effective than DSSS in crowded/indoor environments
  - DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum)
    - Data streams divided and encoded into small chunks (chips)
    - Chips are spread over all available frequencies within one of three channels all at the same time
- Wireless standards in various bands
  - Wi-Fi --> DSSS
  - [[Bluetooth]] --> FHSS
  - [[ZigBee]] --> DSSS
  - ANT+ uses fixed frequency (neither DSSS or FHSS)

## Antennas

- Used to provide a path for signals to travel
  - Air doesn't provide a path like cables would
- Signals originate from electrical current traveling along a conductor
  - Travels from transmitter to antenna
  - Antenna emits signal as a series of electromagnetic waves
  - Signal moves through air to destination
  - At destination, another antenna accepts the signal and a receiver converts it to current
- Two antennas must be tuned to the same frequency to communicate
- Each type of wireless service requires an antenna specifically designed for that service

### Radiation Pattern

- Relative strength over 3D area of all electromagnetic energy that antenna sends/receives
- Unidirectional
  - Directional
  - Issues wireless signals along single direction
- Omnidirectional
  - Sends/receives wireless signals with equal strength/clarity in all directions

## Signal Propagation

- Way in which wave travels from one point to another
- LOS (line of site)
  - Ideal signal path
  - Signal travels in straight line directly from transmitter to receiver
  - Maximizes distance for amount of energy used
  - Results in clearest possible signal
- When obstacles are in the way, signal may:
  - Pass through obstacle
  - Be absorbed
  - Fading
    - Energy fades as it runs into obstacles
    - Excessive fading can cause dropped connections or slow transmission
  - Attenuation
    - Signal weakens (moving away from transmission antenna)
    - How to correct
      - Increase power of transmission
      - Repeat signal from closer broadcast point (wireless range extender)
  - Interference
    - Wireless signals are vulnerable to noise
      - They have no shielding
    - SNR --> signal to noise ratio
  - Refraction
    - Alteration of direction, speed, and wavelength
    - Happens when wave is traveling into/through different mediums
  - Reflection
  - Scattering
    - Diffusion in multiple directions
  - Diffraction
    - Split into secondary waves

## Topologies

- Different than wired networks because they are not bound by cabling paths
- Types
  - Ad hoc
    - Small number of nodes closely positioned
    - No intervening connectivity device
    - E.g. multiple computers directly communicating
  - Infrastructure
    - Uses intervening connectivity device
      - E.g. WAP or AP
  - Mesh
    - Several APs work as peer devices on same network
    - More fault-tolerant

## Troubleshooting

- Tools
  - Spectrum analyzer
    - Assess the quality of wireless signals
  - Wireless analyzer (Wi-Fi analyzer)
    - Evaluate Wi-Fi network availability
    - Optimize Wi-Fi signal settings
    - Help identify Wi-Fi security threats
