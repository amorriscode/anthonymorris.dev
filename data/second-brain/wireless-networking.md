# Wireless Networking

- Most wireless devices implement one of two technologies:
  - FHSS (frequency hopping spread spectrum)
  - DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum)
- Wireless standards in various bands
  - Wi-Fi --> DSSS
  - [[Bluetooth]] --> FHSS
  - [[ZigBee]] --> DSSS
  - ANT+ uses fixed frequency (neither DSSS or FHSS)

## Antennas

- Signals originate from electrical current traveling along a conductor
  - Travels from transmitter to antenna
  - Antenna emits signal as a series of electromagnetic waves
  - At destination, another antenna accepts the signal and a receiver concerts it to current
- Two antennas must be tuned to the same frequency to communicate

### Radiation Pattern

- Relative strength over 3D area of all electromagnetic energy that antenna sends/receives
- Unidirectional
  - Directional
  - Issues wireless signals along single direction
- Omnidirectional
  - Sends/receives wireless signals with equal strength/clarity in all directions

## Signal Propagation

- Way in which wave travels from one point to another
- LOS (line of site)
  - Signal travels in straight line directly from transmitter to receiver
- When obstacles are in the way, signal may:
  - Pass through
  - Be absorbed
  - Experience:
    - Fading
      - Energy fades as it runs into obstacles
      - Excessive fading can cause dropped connections or slow transmission
    - Attenuation
      - Signal weakens (moving away from transmission antenna)
      - How to correct
        - Increase power of transmission
        - Repeat signal from closer broadcast point (wireless range extender)
    - Interference
      - Wireless signals are vulnerable to noise
        - They have no shielding
    - Refraction
    - Reflection
    - Scattering
      - Diffusion in multiple directions
    - Diffraction
      - Split into secondary waves

## Troubleshooting

- Tools
  - Spectrum analyzer
    - Assess the quality of wireless signals
  - Wireless analyzer (Wi-Fi analyzer)
    - Evaluate Wi-Fi network availability
    - Optimize Wi-Fi signal settings
    - Help identify Wi-Fi security threats
