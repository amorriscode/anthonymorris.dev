# The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe
- Written by [[Dr. Steven Novella]]

## Introduction
- The essence of skepticism --> How to we know what to believe and what to doubt?
- How do we _know_ anything?
- Things this book aims to teach:
	- How our brains fail us
	- How we prefer simple/clean stories
	- How bad our memory is
	- How biases impact our thinking
	- Failures of society
	- Imperfections in the institutions of science, learning, and journalism
- Cynicism is cheap
	- It holds back progress
- Skeptics combine science, philosophy, psychology, and all the flaws/biases of being human to evaluate claims and beliefs

## 1. Scientific Skepticism
- [[Critical thinking]]
- Term was coined by [[Carl Sagan]]
- Approach to knowledge that prefers beliefs and conclusions that are reliable and valid over anything comforting or convenient
- Scientific skeptics rigorously apply science to reason about their thoughts and opinions
- Different from philosophical skepticism
	- Philosophical skepticism is a position of almost permanent doubt
		- Can we actually know anything?
		- What is the nature of knowledge itself?
- Start with doubt and try to separate truth from fantasy, wishful thinking, biases, and tradition
- Tools used to parse reality:
	- Respect for knowledge and truth
		- Try to be as reality-based as possible
		- Subject claims to a rigorous process of evaluation
		- The world is knowable due to the laws of nature
	- Promotion of science
		- Science is the only legitimate way to investigate and understand the natural world
		- We must defend and spread the use and understanding of scientific methods
	- Promotion of reason and critical thinking
	- Science vs pseudoscience
		- Seek to expose pseudoscience
		- You must understand how science can go wrong
	- Ideological freedom / free inquiry
		- Science and reason can only flourish when ideology is not imposed
	- Neuropsychological humility
		- We must know how we deceive ourselves, the limits of our perception and memory, the biases and fallacies of our cognition, and how to mitigate all these flaws
	- Consumer protection
		- Expose fraud and deception
		- Combat misinformation
