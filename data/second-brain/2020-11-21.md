- Reading [[Plato]]'s [[Protagoras (dialogue)]]
  - Why do people dislike the [[Sophist]]s?
  - Why does [[Socrates]] speak for [[Hippocrates]]?
  - What does the [[eunuch]] slamming the door in their face represent?
    - Why is [[Protagoras]], a [[sophist]], inside but the [[eunuch]] slams the door assuming [[Socrates]] and [[Hippocrates]] are [[sophist]]s?
  - [[Protagoras]] teaches the art of [[politics]] and makes "good citizens" out of men
    - Teaching virtue
