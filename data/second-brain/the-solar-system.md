![Orbits and tilts of the planets](/assets/second-brain/2020-12-06-14-07-20.png)

- Our local [[solar system]]
- [[Planet]]s
  - [[Terrestrial planet]]s
  - [[Jovian planet]]s
  - Our week has 7 days because there are 7 observable moving objects in the sky
    - [[The Moon]], [[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]]
  - Our month is based on how long the [[Moon]] takes to complete a trip around the sky
    - *Moonth*
- Traveling at 230 km/s
- The nearest star to us is [[Proxima Centauri]]
- Objects in the solar system formed ~4.5 billion years ago

## Mass of Members

- Masses of [[planet]]s originally measured using [[Johannes Kepler]]'s laws of [[planetary motion]]

| Object                                      | Percentage of Total Mass of Solar System |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [[Sun]]                                     | 99.80%                                   |
| [[Jupiter]]                                 | 0.10%                                    |
| Comets                                      | approx. 0.0005-0.03%                     |
| All other [[planet]]s and dwarf [[planet]]s | 0.04%                                    |
| Moons and rings                             | 0.00005%                                 |
| [[Asteroid]]s                               | approx. 0.000002%                        |
| Cosmic dust                                 | approx. 0.0000001%                       |

## Characteristics

- Orderly motion
  - Nearly circular orbits in the same plane
  - Everything is moving counter clockwise
  - Almost all spinning counter clockwise
- [[Asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s
  - [[Asteroid]] --> more rocky than icy
  - [[Comet]] --> more icy than rocky
- Exceptions
  - When [[astronomer]]s have trouble explaining something, they often assume something hit it
  - Examples
    - [[Venus]] upside down
    - [[Uranus]] sideways
    - [[The Moon]] is relatively huge
      - Largest [[moon]]:[[planet]] ratio

## Formation

- Took ~100 million years
- We have the rules
  - [[Johannes Kepler]]'s laws
  - [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Laws of Motion]]
- Forces and interactions
  - [[Gravity]]
  - Angular momentum (Kepler's second law)
  - Particles heating up, moving faster, bumping into one another
- Can learn about formation by looking at patterns
  - All the [[planet]]s lie in nearly the same plane
  - All the [[planet]]s revolve around the [[Sun]] in the same direction
  - The [[Sun]] spins in the same direction about its own axis
  - It seems as though the [[Sun]] and [[planet]]s formed together from the solar nebula
- Planet composition
  - Spectroscopic analysis --> which elements are present
  - [[Sun]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] --> similar elements
    - Hydrogen-dominated composition
  - Terrestrial [[planet]]s and [[the Moon]] --> similar elements
    - Deficient in light gases and various ices that form from elements like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen
    - Rarer heavy elements
  - Inner [[planet]]s are made of elements that can survive heat
  - Outer [[solar system]] is much cooler so ice/gas can exist
  - [[Planet]]s must form before materials get blown into outer space by solar wind
    - ISM --> [[interstellar medium]]

### Steps

![Steps in forming the Solar System](/assets/second-brain/2020-12-04-12-47-02.png)

- Start with a blob or cloud of gas and dust
  - Must have rotation
- Begins to contract because of its own [[gravity]]
  - Or could have been hit by a shockwave
- Proto-sun forms
- Disk flattens and rotates faster
  - [[Accretion disk]]
    - Rotation slows collapse in the plane of rotation forming a disk
    - Smaller particles run into larger particles forming larger and large chunks
      - Planetesimals
    - Disk also heats up through gravitational contraction
      - Up to hundreds of Kelvin
    - Material near the centre is moving faster so temperature --> higher
- [[Sun]] turns 'on'
  - Starts shining
  - Removes gases from inner areas --> leaving dust and debris
- Gas [[planet]]s can form farther Outer
