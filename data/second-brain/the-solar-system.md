# The Solar System

![Our solar family](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-06-21-10-47.png)

- Our local [[solar system]]
- [[Planet]]s
  - Terrestrial [[planet]]s
    - Relatively small worlds
    - Composed of primarily rock and metal
    - All have solid surfaces that bear records of geological history
    - Members
      - [[Mercury]]
      - [[Venus]]
      - [[Earth]]
      - [[Mars]]
  - Jovian [[planet]]s / Giant [[planet]]s
    - Much larger
    - Composed primarily of lighter ices, liquids, and gases
    - Named after Jove
      - Another name for [[Jupiter]] in [[mythology]]
    - All have ring systems made up of countless small bodies
      - Range from size of mountains --> grains of dust
    - Members
      - [[Jupiter]]
      - [[Saturn]]
      - [[Uranus]]
      - [[Neptune]]
  - Our week has 7 days because there are 7 observable moving objects in the sky
    - [[Moon]], [[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]]
  - Our month is based on how long the [[Moon]] takes to complete a trip around the sky
    - _Moonth_
- Traveling at 230 km/s
- The nearest star to us is [[Proxima Centauri]]
- Objects in the solar system formed ~4.5 billion years ago

## Mass of Members

- Masses of [[planet]]s originally measured using [[Johannes Kepler]]'s laws of [[planetary motion]]

| Object                                      | Percentage of Total Mass of Solar System |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [[Sun]]                                     | 99.80%                                   |
| [[Jupiter]]                                 | 0.10%                                    |
| Comets                                      | approx. 0.0005-0.03%                     |
| All other [[planet]]s and dwarf [[planet]]s | 0.04%                                    |
| Moons and rings                             | 0.00005%                                 |
| [[Asteroid]]s                               | approx. 0.000002%                        |
| Cosmic dust                                 | approx. 0.0000001%                       |

## Creation

- Can learn about creation by looking at patterns
  - All the [[planet]]s lie in nearly the same plane
  - All the [[planet]]s revolve around the [[Sun]] in the same direction
  - The [[Sun]] spins in the same direction about its own axis
  - It seems as though the [[Sun]] and [[planet]]s formed together from the solar nebula
- Planet composition
  - Spectroscopic analysis --> which elements are present
  - [[Sun]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] --> similar elements
    - Hydrogen-dominated composition
  - Terrestrial [[planet]]s and our [[Moon]] --> similar elements
    - Deficient in light gases and various ices that form from elements like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen
    - Rarer heavy elements
  - Inner [[planet]]s are made of elements that can survive heat
  - Outer [[solar system]] is much cooler so ice/gas can exist
