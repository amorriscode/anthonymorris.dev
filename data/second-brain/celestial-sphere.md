- An imaginary, hollow dome surrounding the [[Earth]]
  - It's essentially the sky we see when we look up
- It's what you see when you look up at the sky; you are at the center
- The **zenith** is the point directly above your head
- The **horizon** is where the dome meets the [[Earth]]
- The path the [[Sun]] takes on the celestial sphere is called the **ecliptic**
