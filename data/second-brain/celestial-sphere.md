# Celestial Sphere

![The celestial sphere](/assets/second-brain/2020-09-08-20-03-08.png)

- An imaginary, hollow dome surrounding the [[Earth]]
  - It's essentially the sky we see when we look up
  - [[Earth]]'s coordinate system has been extended to the sphere
- It's what you see when you look up at the sky; you are at the center
- The path the [[Sun]] takes on the celestial sphere is called the **ecliptic**
  - Apparent yearly path of the [[Sun]]
  - Projection of the [[Earth]]'s orbit onto the sky
  - Tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to the [[celestial equator]]

## Coordinate System

- **Declination**
  - Vertical position of an object
  - Celestial equivalent of [[latitude]]
  - Degrees, arcmin, arcsec
- **Right ascension**
  - Horizontal position of an object
  - Celestial equivalent of [[longitude]]
  - Expressed as either degrees or units of time
    - Celestial sphere turns around the [[Earth]] once a day
      - As [[Earth]] turns on its axis
      - 360˚ can easily just be 24 hours
      - 15˚ arc is equal to 1 hour
    - Hours, mins, sec
  - Starts getting counted at the [[vernal equinox]]
- **Altitude**
  - Vertical position of an object
  - Angle from the horizon to a point on the sphere
  - Zenith is 90˚
  - Altitude of [[Polaris]] with give you the [[latitude]] of where you are on [[Earth]]
- **Azimuth**
  - Horizontal position of an object
  - Angle measured clockwise around observer's horizon from north
  - Object due north has azimuth of 0˚

### Relative to Viewer

- Zenith
  - Point directly above your head
- Horizon
  - Where the dome meets the [[Earth]]
