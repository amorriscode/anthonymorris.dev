[[artificial neural network|ANN]] [[artificial intelligence|AI]] [[calculus]]
# Gradient descent
- A [[heuristic]] method that starts at a random point and iteratively moves in the direction that decreases a function you want to minimize
- In [[artificial neural network|ANN]]s this is the [[loss function]]
	- The step size that is used to decrease the result of the function is called the learning rate
