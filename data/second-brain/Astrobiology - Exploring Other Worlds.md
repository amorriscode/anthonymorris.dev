# Astrobiology: Exploring Other Worlds
- Taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astrobiology-exploring-other-worlds)
- Great visualizations of concepts (eg. [[doppler effect|doppler shift]])

## Week 1 - Planets in the Solar System and Beyond
- [[astrobiology|Astrobiology]] is asking "are we alone in the [[universe]]"?
- There are many [[planet]]s in the [[universe]] but how many of them contain [[life]]?
- It's tough to define [[life]]
	- Usually we imagine [[carbon]] and [[water]]

### Exoplanets
- [[planet|Planet]]s beyond our [[the solar system]]
	- [[planet|Planet]]s not orbiting our [[sun]]
- Our situation in cosmic space
	- [[Earth]] is ~26,000 [[light year]]s away from the galactic center
	- The [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]] is 100,000 [[light year]]s in diameter
	- The [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]] is part of a Local Group which is 10 million [[light year]]s in diameter
	- There is nothing special about our place in [[the Solar System]]
- A [[planet]] is a solid (or partially liquid) body orbiting a [[star]]
	- Too small to generate energy by nuclear reactions
- Until recently we couldn't see [[exoplanet]]s directly
- First confirmed [[exoplanet]] was [[51 Pegasi b]]
	- Not an [[Earth]]-like [[planet]]
- We have discovered nearly 4000 [[exoplanet]]s as of [[2018]]
- Many of the first [[exoplanet]]s were hot [[Jupiter]]s (close to their [[star]] but massive)
	- How could they form so close to thier [[star]]s?
- [[Exoplanet]]s tend to have more eccentric [[orbit]]s than in [[the Solar System]]
	- Makes us wonder if [[the Solar System]] is typical in the [[universe]] or not

### Planet Formation
- [[Star]]s are born in [[molecular cloud]]s
	- These clouds collapse and become dense ([[gravitational collapse]])
	- [[Accretion disk]] is formed
		- Small objects gather and stick together
- The type of [[exoplanet]] which a protoplanet will develop into depends where it is positioned in the [[accretion disk]]
	- [[terrestrial planet|Rocky planet]]s
		- Inside the [[frost line]]
		- Available material is primarily rock and dust
	- [[jovian planet|Gas giant planet]]s / [[jovian planet|ice giant planet]]
		- Outside the [[frost line]]
		- Protoplanetary disk is mostly ice and gold gas (still has rock and dust)
- [[Differentiation]]
- Summary
	1. [[Molecular cloud]] collapse
	2. Protoplanetary disk
	3. Accretion
	4. [[Differentiation]]
- There are ~100-400 billion [[star]]s in the [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]]
	- Some live very short lives
	- More long-lived than short-lived
	- Recent results from [[kepler space telescope]] suggest that between 1/5 to 1/2 of all [[star]]s have at least one [[planet]]
		- `0.2 * 1000 billion stars = 20,000,000,000` --> conservative estimate is 20 billion stars in the [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]]

### Planets and Moons
- The surface of rocky planets is constantly changing
	- Geologically active
- Magnetic shields are a product of [[differentiation]]
	- Shield the surface from harmful rays of space
	- Helps a [[planet]] retain its [[atmosphere]]
- [[Planet]]s near their [[star]]:
	- Hot
	- Cannot keep light gasses in their [[atmosphere]]s
	- If they are very close, they tidally lock their [[star]] (one side always facing the star)
- [[Planet]]s far from their [[star]]:
	- Cold
	- May not have liquids on their surface
	- Can retain a thick [[atmosphere]]
	- May have subterranean liquids
- Ices --> mostly frozen [[hydrogen]] compounds
	- [[Water]]
	- [[Methane]]
	- [[Ammonia]]
	- [[Carbon dioxide]]
- [[Moon]]s form around planetesimals
- We haven't detected [[moon]]s around [[exoplanet]]s
	- Too small to detect

### Our Solar System
- [[The Solar System]] might not be typical but we do believe [[planet]]/[[moon]] formation is universal
- [[Planet]]s
	- [[Mercury]]
		- Geologically dead; no [[atmosphere]]
	- [[Venus]]
		- Almost identical to [[Earth]] in size, mass, and interior structure
		- Runaway [[greenhouse effect]]
		- Might have been habitable 3 billion years ago
	- [[Earth]]
		- Thick atmosphere helps with water retention
	- [[Mars]]
		- Smaller than [[Earth]]
		- Old, cratered surface
		- Evidence it was wet in the past
	- [[Jupiter]]
		- 71% of the mass of all [[planet]]s in [[the Solar System]]
	- [[Saturn]]
	- [[Uranus]]
		- Large axial tilt (probably from being hit)
	- [[Neptune]]

### Hot Jupiters and Planet Migration
- Hot [[Jupiter]]
	- [[jovian planet|gas giant planet]] with [[mass]] equal to, or great than, [[Jupiter]]
	- Tight [[orbit]] close to their parent [[star]]
	- Surpising that they event exist
		- Simulations suggested they should not exist
		- Caused us to rethink [[planet]] formation theories
	- Planetary migration
		- [[Planet]]s may drastically change orbital distances before settling into their final [[orbit]]
		- Explains how hot Jupiters would end up with an orbital path close to their [[star]]
	- The Grand Tack theory
		- How [[Jupiter]] may have experience planetary migration in our solar system
		- Cleared out some debris in the solar system and also caused the period of [[heavy bombardment]]
	- Extremely hard to verify models of the early solar system

### Water Worlds
- [[Planet]]s like the [[Earth]]
- [[jovian planet|Ice giant planet]]
	- First ice giant exoplanet was discovered in 2014
- Small [[exoplanet]]s typically come in two sizes
	- Mini-[[Neptune]]s
		- Smaller or less massive
	- Super-[[Earth]]s
		- Like [[Earth]] but larger or more massive
- Measuring mass of planets
	- [Minimum mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mass)
	- Detected using the [[radial velocity]] method ([[Doppler spectroscopy]])
	- Real orbital inclinations and true masses are generally unkown (sin _i_ degeneracy)

## Week 2 - Hunting for Exoplanets
- How do we find [[exoplanet]]s?
	- Small and trillions of miles away
- Two methods for finding
	- Wobble observation
		- Observing red and blue shift as it moves towards/away from us
	- Brightness of its [[star]] will dip as it orbits in front

### Gravity and the Doppler Shift
- Core technique used to find the first [[exoplanet]]s
- Reflex motion
	- Gravitational pull of massive [[planet]]s (like [[Jupiter]]) is enough to exert gravitational influence on their [[star]]
	- We don't actually see the [[star]] move from large distances but observe a red and blue shift
	- [[doppler effect|doppler shift]]
	- Toward us --> blue shift (compressed waves)
	- Away from us --> red shift

## The Radial Velocity Method
- Uses [[reflex motion]] to detect [[exoplanet]]s
- Magnitude of the [[doppler effect|Doppler shift]] indicates the speed of the [[reflex motion]] (or [[radial velocity]]) of the [[star]]
- Limitations
	- Limiting mass
		- Bigger [[planet]]s --> obvious shifts in the light from the [[star]]
		- Smaller [[planet]]s --> smaller shifts
			- Some [[planet]]s are so small the shift is imperceptible
	- Orbital distance
		- Gravitational influence decreases over distance
		- Large orbital distances --> barely detectable [[reflex motion]] (even for massive [[planet]]s)
	- Only measures [[mass]], not size
	- Can't determine [[orbital inclination]]
