# Astrobiology: Exploring Other Worlds
- Taken on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astrobiology-exploring-other-worlds)

## Week 1 - Planets in the Solar System and Beyond
- [[astrobiology|Astrobiology]] is asking "are we alone in the [[universe]]"?
- There are many [[planet]]s in the [[universe]] but how many of them contain [[life]]?
- It's tough to define [[life]]
	- Usually we imagine [[carbon]] and [[water]]

### Exoplanets
- [[planet|Planet]]s beyond our [[the solar system]]
	- [[planet|Planet]]s not orbiting our [[sun]]
- Our situation in cosmic space
	- [[Earth]] is ~26,000 [[light year]]s away from the galactic center
	- The [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]] is 100,000 [[light year]]s in diameter
	- The [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]] is part of a Local Group which is 10 million [[light year]]s in diameter
	- There is nothing special about our place in [[the Solar System]]
- A [[planet]] is a solid (or partially liquid) body orbiting a [[star]]
	- Too small to generate energy by nuclear reactions
- Until recently we couldn't see [[exoplanet]]s directly
- First confirmed [[exoplanet]] was [[51 Pegasi b]]
	- Not an [[Earth]]-like [[planet]]
- We have discovered nearly 4000 [[exoplanet]]s as of [[2018]]
- Many of the first [[exoplanet]]s were hot [[Jupiter]]s (close to their [[star]] but massive)
	- How could they form so close to thier [[star]]s?
- [[Exoplanet]]s tend to have more eccentric [[orbit]]s than in [[the Solar System]]
	- Makes us wonder if [[the Solar System]] is typical in the [[universe]] or not

### Planet Formation
- [[Star]]s are born in [[molecular cloud]]s
	- These clouds collapse and become dense ([[gravitational collapse]])
	- [[Accretion disk]] is formed
		- Small objects gather and stick together
- The type of [[exoplanet]] which a protoplanet will develop into depends where it is positioned in the [[accretion disk]]
	- [[terrestrial planet|Rocky planet]]s
		- Inside the [[frost line]]
		- Available material is primarily rock and dust
	- [[jovian planet|Gas giant planet]]s / [[jovian planet|ice giant planet]]
		- Outside the [[frost line]]
		- Protoplanetary disk is mostly ice and gold gas (still has rock and dust)
- [[Differentiation]]
- Summary
	1. [[Molecular cloud]] collapse
	2. Protoplanetary disk
	3. Accretion
	4. [[Differentiation]]
- There are ~100-400 billion [[star]]s in the [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]]
	- Some live very short lives
	- More long-lived than short-lived
	- Recent results from [[kepler space telescope]] suggest that between 1/5 to 1/2 of all [[star]]s have at least one [[planet]]
		- `0.2 * 1000 billion stars = 20,000,000,000` --> conservative estimate is 20 billion stars in the [[milky way galaxy|Milky Way]]

### Planets and Moons
- The surface of rocky planets is constantly changing
	- Geologically active
- Magnetic shields are a product of [[differentiation]]
	- Shield the surface from harmful rays of space
	- Helps a [[planet]] retain its [[atmosphere]]
- [[Planet]]s near their [[star]]:
	- Hot
	- Cannot keep light gasses in their [[atmosphere]]s
	- If they are very close, they tidally lock their [[star]] (one side always facing the star)
- [[Planet]]s far from their [[star]]:
	- Cold
	- May not have liquids on their surface
	- Can retain a thick [[atmosphere]]
	- May have subterranean liquids
- Ices --> mostly frozen [[hydrogen]] compounds
	- [[Water]]
	- [[Methane]]
	- [[Ammonia]]
	- [[Carbon dioxide]]
- [[Moon]]s form around planetesimals
- We haven't detected [[moon]]s around [[exoplanet]]s
	- Too small to detect
