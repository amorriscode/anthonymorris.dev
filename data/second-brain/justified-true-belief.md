# Justified True Belief

- According to [[Plato]], true belief is not enough for [[knowledge]]
  - It must be *justified*
  - Person who is justified is in a position to speak to objections of their belief
    - A lucky guesser will have more trouble defending their belief
- In order for something to be true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so
- $S$ knows that $P$ if any only if:
  - $P$ is true
  - $S$ believes that $P$ is true
  - $S$ is justified in believing that $P$ is true
