# Justified True Belief

- According to [[Plato]], true belief is not enough for [[knowledge]]
  - It must be $justified$
  - Person who is justified is in a position to speak to objections of their belief
    - A lucky guesser will have more trouble defending their belief
- When you have [[knowledge]], then you have an opportunity to teach it
- $S$ knows that $P$ if any only if:
  - $P$ is true
  - $S$ beliefs that $P$ is true
  - $S$ is justified in believing that $P$ is true
