# Scientific Method

1. Observation
   - See something interesting or new
2. Hypothesis (theory)
   - Develop a theory with restrictions/rules to explain observation
3. Prediction
   - Theory must include a testable prediction
   - If the theory is correct, the prediction should occur
4. Test
   - Design an experiment to test/observe the theory
