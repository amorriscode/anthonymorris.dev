1. There will always be too much to do
	- We will never be able to do all the things we want to do, instead we have to get good at choosing what to neglect
	- Ruthlessly prioritize and trim the rest
2. When stumped on decisions, focus on growth over happiness
	- We're bad at predicting happiness
	- Growth is always a value add
3. Increase capacity to tolerate minor discomforts
	- Like training in the gym
	- Seek discomfort and work through it
4. The advice you don't want to hear is the advice you need
	- Look for hard truths
5. The future will never provide the reassurance you seek
	- Focus more on what we can control (the present)
6. The solution to imposter syndrome is that you are one
	- No one knows what they're doing (and that's okay)
	- Two types of people out there:
		- Those who are improvising through life and putting out fires as they go
		- Those who pretend they aren't in the first group
7. Selflessness is overrated
	- Direct energy to your own ambitions and enthusiasms 
	- You get one shot at life!
8. Know when to move on
