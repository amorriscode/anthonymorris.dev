# Atom

- Consists of several types of [[particle]]s
  - A number of which have mass _and_ an electric charge
  - The [[electron]], [[proton]], and [[neutron]]
    - Nucleus contains [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s
    - Outside of the nucleus we have [[electron]]s
- Electrically neutral in its normal state
- Each type of atom has its own unique pattern of [[electron]] [[orbit]]s
  - No two sets of [[orbit]]s are exactly alike

## Atomic Nucleus

- **Strong nuclear force**
  - Holds [[particle]]s together
  - Only capable of acting over distances about the size of the atomic nucleus
  - Attractive [[force]]
  - Stronger than the electrical [[force]]
