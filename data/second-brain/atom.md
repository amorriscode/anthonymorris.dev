# Atom

- Consists of several types of particles
  - A number of which have mass _and_ an electric charge
- [[Nucleus]] contains [[proton]]s
- Outside of the [[nucleus]] we have [[electron]]s
- Electrically neutral in its normal state
- Each type of atom has its own unique pattern of [[electron]] orbits
  - No two sets of orbits are exactly alike
