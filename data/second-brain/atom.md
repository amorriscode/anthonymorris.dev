# Atom

- Consists of several types of particles
  - A number of which have mass _and_ an electric charge
- Nucleus contains [[proton]]s
- Outside of the nucleus we have [[electron]]s
- Electrically neutral in its normal state
- Each type of atom has its own unique pattern of [[electron]] orbits
  - No two sets of orbits are exactly alike

## Atomic Nucleus

- **Strong nuclear force**
  - Holds [[Particle]]s particles together
  - Only capable of acting over distances about the size of the atomic nucleus
  - Attractive force
  - Stronger than the electrical force
