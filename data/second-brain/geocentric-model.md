# Geocentric Model

- Overly complex
  - Lack of understanding led to things like an equant point
- Predicted positions of planets for any date and time
- All [[orbit]]s were circular
- Retrograde motion had to be explained in a unique way since [[Earth]] was not moving
  - Planets revolved in their own epicycles
  - Those epicycles revolved around [[Earth]]
