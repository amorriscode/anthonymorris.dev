# Stellar Evolution

## Formation

- [[Jeans instability]]
- [[Hydrostatic equilibrium]]
  - Balance of [[pressure]] and [[gravity]]
- Must be more than 0.08 solar masses to kickstart [[fusion]] and become a true star
  - Otherwise they become [[brown dwarf]]s

## Final Stage

- Depend on initial [[mass]] of the [[star]]
- [[Red dwarf]]s
  - Convert entire [[mass]] into [[helium]]
  - Never go through a giant phase
    - Not enough [[mass]] to start [[helium]] [[fusion]]
