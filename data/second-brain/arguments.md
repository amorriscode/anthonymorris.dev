# Arguments

- An attempt to justify a conclusion by rational means
- Set of statements consisting of:
  - One or more premises (supporting statements)
  - A conclusion (statement in need of support)
- Two forms of arguments:
  - [Deductive](#deductive-arguments)
  - [Non-deductive](#non-deductive)
- A bad argument can have a true conclusion
- "Is this a good argument?" !== "Do you agree with the conclusion?"

## Forms of Arguments

### Deductive Arguments

- _Intends_ to provide conclusive support for its conclusion
  - When providing conclusive support for its conclusion, it is **valid**
  - When _not_ providing conclusive support for its conclusion, it is **invalid**
  - Validity is _all or nothing_
- If _premises_ provided are true, the _conclusion_ must be true
  - Are premises true?
  - Do the premises lead to this conclusion?
- True premises aren't enough (must be valid)
  - Gasoline is poison (true)
  - Bleach is poison (true)
  - **Conclusion:** gasoline is bleach (false)
- Deductively valid arguments with true premises are **sound**
  - Valid arguments are not necessarily true (sound)!

#### Example

- Unjustly killing innocent people is wrong
- THe holocaust was a case of unjustly killing innocent people
- **Conclusion:** Holocaust was wrong

### Non-deductive

- Tries to provide probable support for its conclusion
  - A conclusion should seem _more likely_ to be true
  - Not definitive truth
- Subdivides into:
  - **Inductive**
    - Pattern probably holds in general based on an existing observation
  - **Abductive**
    - A theory is _probably_ true because the theory is the best that exists for the conclusion
    - Compared to the alternatives the argument is best
    - _Inference to the best explanation_
    - Many philosophers think scientific theories are commonly supposed by abduction
    - Does not positively verify the conclusion
- A non-deductive argument providing probable support is **strong**
  - Strength comes in degrees
- A **strong** argument with true premises is **cogent**
  - Cogency runs parallel to soundness
  - Cogent arguments can have false conclusions

## Reconstructing Arguments

- Piece together an argument from a passage of text
- There may be missing pieces
  - Hidden premises or conclusions
  - Can happen due to various reasons:
    - Lazy author
    - Think premise(s) are obvious
- Look for a conclusion indicator (eg. _so_)
- How to find missing premises
  - Search for credible premise that would make argument valid (or as strong as possible)
  - Choose premise that is:
    - Most plausible
    - Fits best with author's intent
    - Principle of Clarity
      - Always attribute the _strongest_ possible interpretation of an author's position consistent with the text

## Evaluating Arguments

- Think about two questions:
  - Are the premises of this argument true?
  - Assuming the premises are true, to what extend do they support the conclusion?
- Look out for faulty reasoning
  - A [[fallacy]]
  - Error in reasoning that commonly persuades people

### Begging the Question

- Attempt to establish conclusion of an argument by using the conclusion as a premise
- Usually some disguised version of the conclusion is a premise
