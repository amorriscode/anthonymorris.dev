- Moving from history/tools to objects in the [[Solar System]]
  - Starting with the [[Sun]]
- Easier to make small [[star]]s than big [[star]]s
- [[Albert Einstein]]
  - $E = mc^2$
  - [[Matter]] and [[energy]] are the same thing
    - Doesn't make much sense on a large macroscopic scale
    - Makes more sense on nuclear scales
  - [[Fusion]] vs. [[fission]]
    - Bringing together vs. breaking down
- Light elements (up to [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fusion]]
- Heavy elements (past [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fission]]
