[[astr-1101]]

- Moving from history/tools to objects in the [[Solar System]]
  - Starting with the [[Sun]]
- Easier to make small [[star]]s than big [[star]]s
- [[Albert Einstein]]
  - $E = mc^2$
  - [[Matter]] and [[energy]] are the same thing
    - Doesn't make much sense on a large macroscopic scale
    - Makes more sense on nuclear scales
  - [[Fusion]] vs. [[fission]]
    - Bringing together vs. breaking down
- Light elements (up to [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fusion]]
- Heavy elements (past [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fission]]
- Comparative planetology
  - Studying how [[planet]]s work by comparing them with one another
- Geological age of surfaces
  - Count craters
    - More impacts --> exposed longer
    - How long since the surface has been "swept clean" by things like lava flow or molten materials
  - Radioactive rocks
    - Measure the age of individual rocks
    - Measuring the half-life of certain elements

[[cpsc-1050]]

- Problem solving and [[algorithm]]s
- Problem solving
  - Act of finding a solution to perplexing, distressing, vexing, or unsettled problems
- How to solve problems
  - Understand the problem
  - Devise a plan
  - Execute the plan
  - Look back/reflect
- Strategies
  - Ask questions
  - Look for familiar things
  - Divide and conquer
- [[Computer]] problem solving process
  - Analysis and specification phase
    - Understand/define the problem
    - Specify the problem the program will solve
  - Algorithm development phase
    - Develop logical sequence of steps to solve the problem
    - Follow the defined steps to see if solution solves the problem
  - Implementation phase
    - Code the algorithm
    - Test the code
  - Maintenance phase
    - Fix bugs, etc.
