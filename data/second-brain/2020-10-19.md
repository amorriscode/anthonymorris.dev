[[astr-1101]]

- Moving from history/tools to objects in the [[Solar System]]
  - Starting with the [[Sun]]
- Easier to make small [[star]]s than big [[star]]s
- [[Albert Einstein]]
  - $E = mc^2$
  - [[Matter]] and [[energy]] are the same thing
    - Doesn't make much sense on a large macroscopic scale
    - Makes more sense on nuclear scales
  - [[Fusion]] vs. [[fission]]
    - Bringing together vs. breaking down
- Light elements (up to [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fusion]]
- Heavy elements (past [[iron]]) --> get energy out of [[fission]]
- Comparative planetology
  - Studying how [[planet]]s work by comparing them with one another
- Geological age of surfaces
  - Count craters
    - More impacts --> exposed longer
    - How long since the surface has been "swept clean" by things like lava flow or molten materials
  - Radioactive rocks
    - Measure the age of individual rocks
    - Measuring the half-life of certain elements
