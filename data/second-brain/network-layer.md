- Responsible for moving messages from one node to another until destination is reached
- IP adds own network layer header to segment or datagram
  - Entire network layer message is called a **packet**
- IP addresses are used to identify hosts
- IP relies on several routing protocols
  - Help find the best route for a packet to take
  - Examples: ICMP, ARP
- Divides large packets into small packets
  - Fragmentation
