# Chromatic Aberration

![Chromatic aberration in a telescope](/assets/second-brain/2021-02-05-09-43-56.png)

- Failure of a [[lens]] to focus all colours to the same position
  - Longer [[wavelength]] light (reds) are bent less than shorter [[wavelength]] light (blues)
- Caused by [[dispersion]]
- Looks like fringes of colour along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of an image
