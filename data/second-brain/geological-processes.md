# Geological Processes

- Surfaces are relatively smooth
- What makes the surfaces not exactly flat?

## Impact Craters

- Circular
- More small ones than large ones
- Generally 10x larger than the object that created them
- 10-20% as deep as they are wide
- Central peak
  - Walls pressing back on the middle

## Volcanism

- [[Volcano]]es
- Underground molten rock finds path to the surface
- Lower density, squeezed up, expanding gasses

## Tectonics

- [[Plate tectonics]]
  - Transform boundaries
    - Sliding sideways
  - Divergent boundaries
  - Convergent boundaries

## Erosion

- Breakdown or transport of rock
- Glaciers, rivers, wind
- Sand dunes
- Sedimentary rock
