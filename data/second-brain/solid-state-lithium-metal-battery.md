# Solid-State Lithium Metal Battery

- Promise to swap the [[graphite]] [[anode]] of a [[lithium-ion battery]] for one made of pure [[lithium]]
  - Can remove the liquid [[electrolyte]] in favour of a solid one
  - Dramatically increases [[energy]] density of the [[battery]]
- Could help [[electric vehicle]]s get ranges similar to [[gasoline]]-powered ones
- Being developed by [[QuantumScape]]
