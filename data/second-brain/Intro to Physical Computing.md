## Electricity basics
- [[Electricity]]
	- Flow of electrical energy through conductive materials
- Electrical circuit
	- Power source + components that convert electrical energy into other forms of energy
- Sensors
	- Components that convert other forms of energy into electrical energy so they can be read
	- Switches, knobs, light, motion sensors, etc.
- Actuators
	- Components that convert electrical energy into other forms
	- Light bulbs, motors, LEDs, heaters, etc.
- Transduction
	- Process of changing one form of energy into another
	- Transducers are devices that do this
- [[Voltage]]
- [[electric current]]
- [[Resistance]]
- Ground
	- The place in the circuit where potential energy of electrons is zero
### Voltage <> Current <> Resistance
- Imagine an avalanche of snow on a mountain
	- Height of mountain --> voltage
		- The higher it is, the more potential falling material has
	- Amount of snow/rocks --> current
	- Steepness of the mountain --> resistance
		- Steeper --> less it will resist the flow of snow/rocks
- Volts = Amps x Ohms
	- $V = I \times R$
- Watts = Volts x Amps
	- $P = V \times I$

## Components
- Conductors
	- Materials where electrical current moves freely
- Insulators
	- Materials which prevent the flow of electricity
- Resistors
	- Resist but don't totally block flow of electricity
	- Used to control flow of current
		- Current can flow either way through a resistor
	- Types of resistors
		- Thermistors
			- Change resistance in reaction to temperature
		- Photoresistors
			- Change resistance in reaction to light
		- Flex sensors
			- Change resistance in reaction to being bent/flexed
		- Force sensing resistors
			- Change resistance in reaction to force placed on them
	- Divide voltage when in series
	- Divide amperage when in parallel
- Capacitors
	- Store electricity while current is flowing into them
	- Release energy when incoming current is removed
	- Measured by their capacitance in Farads (or microfarads)
	- Can be polarized so current can only flow through them in one direction
		- Wiring these backwards can damage the capacitor and your circuit
	- Will explode if more voltage is applied than what they are rated for
- Diodes
	- Permit the flow of electricity in one direction, block in the other direction
- Transistors
	- Electrical switching devices
