Fungi are [pretty amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwKuFREOgmo). Different varieties have health benefits. On top of that, it's really fun to [watch timelapses of them growing](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/11/incredible-fungi-timelapse-from-planet-earth-ii/).

They certainly seem similar to plants on the surface. It turns out that they are not plants.

1. They don't have chloroplasts, the important organelle where photosynthesis happens.
2. They don't make their own food like plants do. Instead, they absorb nutrients from their surroundings using digestive enzymes.
3. They are [more closely related to animals than plants](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/phylogeny-of-opisthokonta-and-the-evolution-of-multicellularity-and-complexity-in-fungi-and-metazoa/EB5D74E46B24E1FF73BA40B6BB6CFAF1).

I never would've guessed that animals and fungi are relatives!
