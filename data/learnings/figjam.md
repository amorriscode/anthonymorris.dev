While listening to [David Yarrow](https://davidyarrow.photography) on the [Tim Ferriss Podcast](https://tim.blog/podcast) I learned about the acronym **FIGJAM**. It stands for "Fuck I'm Good, Just Ask Me." [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FIGJAM) claims it has Australian origins.
