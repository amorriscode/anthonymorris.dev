GitHub added the ability to make your profile fancy with a [README file under a repo that is the same as your username](https://github.com/amorriscode/amorriscode). So what can you put in it? Well, mostly just [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). But [sometimes you can use HTML in your Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#html-best-practices). It's pretty barebones. You can't use CSS.

Or can you? ðŸ¤”

You can place SVGs in your Markdown. With SVGs you can include XHTML elements with [foreignObject](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/foreignObject). So what we can do is build out some HTML and CSS inside our `foreignObject`. Now we have the ability to make thinks look pretty and even use CSS animations!

Admittedly, I probably spent more time on this than I should have but [this is what I came up with](https://github.com/amorriscode/amorriscode):
