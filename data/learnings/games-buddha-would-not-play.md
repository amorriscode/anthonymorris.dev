Buddha gave his disciples [a list of games he would not play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_that_Buddha_would_not_play). I found this interesting because Buddha believed these games were a **cause of negligence**. It made me think about what competitiveness does to us. How does it make us treat each other?

I think that competitiveness is certainly useful in many areas, like business. It helps drive innovation. But I'm sure it's also caused plenty of harm throughout our history.
