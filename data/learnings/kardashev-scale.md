[Kurzgesagt](https://kurzgesagt.org) released a video called [What Do Alien Civilizations Look Like?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFK5_Nx9xY). It's about the Kardeshev scale. Like all Kurzgesagt videos, the animation is amazing, the information is interesting, and I highly recommend you take a look.

The [Kardeshev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) is a method used to measure how far a civilization has advanced. It's specifically talking about technological advancement based around the energy consumed by the civilization.

Kardashev defined three levels of civilization:

- **Type I:** The civilization harnesses all the available energy on their _planet_
- **Type II:** The civilization harnesses all the available energy in their _planetary system_
- **Type III:** The civilization harnesses all the available energy in their _host galaxy_

The scale has been extended to include Type 0, Type IV, and more! We are Type 0; we haven't quite mastered our planet yet. I wonder if we'll survive long enough to make or surpass Type I...
