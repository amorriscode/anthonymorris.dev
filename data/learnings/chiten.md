I was [watching a talk for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl1tGiUiTtI) my [we watch tech](https://wewatch.tech) project and the speaker brought up [chitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin). It turns out that chitin is the primary component of cell walls of fungi and exoskeletons of arthropods.

If we look at [bee anatomy](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/insects/bee1.htm), the bee's exoskeleton is made of many small, movable plates of chitin. What's even more interesting is that their wings are made of chitin too! They are extremely thin pieces of their skeleton, but chitin all the same.
