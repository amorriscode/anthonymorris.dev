I've been watching [Chris Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield) on [Masterclass](masterclass.com). He was talking about what it feels like to launch on the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle). Six seconds before the shuttle lifts off, three out of the five rockets it has will light up. They don't have enough power to lift the spacecraft off of the Earth. If anything goes wrong the computers still have an opportunity to abort.
