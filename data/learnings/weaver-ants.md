Have you heard about weaver ants? 🐜

Well let me tell you about them. They live in trees. Their nests are built by weaving leaves together using silk from their larvae. They exist in huge colonies with hundreds of nests spanning many trees. They can have more than **half a million workers**.

Weaver ants are highly territorial. Because of this, they aggressively defend their territory against intruders. When protecting their colonies, they even spray acid at each other.

Nature is amazing. Ants are amazing.
